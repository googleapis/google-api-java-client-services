   * service attached to the instance group.    - CAPPED_AT_MAX_NUM_REPLICAS (WARNING):
   * Autoscaler recommends a size greater than maxNumReplicas.    -
   * CUSTOM_METRIC_DATA_POINTS_TOO_SPARSE (WARNING):      The custom metric samples are not exported

   * The custom metric that was specified does not exist or does not have      the necessary labels.
   * - MIN_EQUALS_MAX (WARNING):      The minNumReplicas is equal to maxNumReplicas. This means the
   * autoscaler cannot add or remove instances from the instance group.    -

   * change automatically. The autoscaling configuration is preserved.    - MODE_ONLY_UP (WARNING):
   * Autoscaling is in the "Autoscale only out" mode. The autoscaler can add      instances but not
   * remove any.    - MORE_THAN_ONE_BACKEND_SERVICE (ERROR):      The instance group cannot be
   * autoscaled because it has more than one      backend service attached to it.    -
   * NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA_AVAILABLE (ERROR):      There is insufficient quota for the necessary
   * resources, such as CPU or      number of instances.    - REGION_RESOURCE_STOCKOUT (ERROR):
   * Shown only for regional autoscalers: there is a resource stockout in      the chosen region.
   * - SCALING_TARGET_DOES_NOT_EXIST (ERROR):      The target to be scaled does not exist.    -
