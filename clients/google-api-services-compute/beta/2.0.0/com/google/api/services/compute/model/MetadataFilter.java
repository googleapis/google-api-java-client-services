/**
 * Opaque filter criteria used by load balancers to restrict routing configuration to a limited set
 * of load balancing proxies. Proxies and sidecars involved in load balancing would typically
 * present metadata to the load balancers that need to match criteria specified here. If a match
 * takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies.
 *
 * For each metadataFilter in this list, if itsfilterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one
 * of thefilterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its
 * filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
 * corresponding labels provided in the metadata.
 *
 * An example for using metadataFilters would be: if load balancing involves Envoys, they receive
 * routing configuration when values inmetadataFilters match values supplied in  of their XDS
 * requests to loadbalancers.
