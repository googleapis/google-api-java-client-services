/**
 * This class represents an address, partial address, or address range. It is intended to be
 * attached to features to identify their address(es). Some important points about addresses: - The
 * addresses in the Geo Schema do *not* include a component for the name of the feature, i.e. they
 * are not self-referential. For example, the name of a feature might be "Zack's Pizza" and its
 * address would be "123 Main Street". Similarly, streets, cities, and counties do not include
 * themselves as part of their address. The address of "Seattle" is "King County, Washington, USA".
 * If want to construct an address that *does* include the feature name, you can simply prepend it
 * to the other address components. - Lakes, mountains, and other natural features do not normally
 * have addresses. Countries also do not have addresses because they are at the top of the political
 * hierarchy. - Address components in the Geo Schema are listed in a particular order, independent
 * of the conventions used by the country in which they occur. The basic order is "smallest to
 * largest" starting with street numbers and routes, then political features, and ending with postal
 * features. The exact rules are defined by the implementation of the
 * AddressComponentOrdering::IsLessThan() function. - Some types of address components may occur
 * more than once in an address. For example, a UK address with a "dependent thoroughfare" would
 * have two components of TYPE_ROUTE (i.e. street names). These are listed in the order they are
 * normally written.
 *
