/**
 * Definition of a unique source of sensor data. Data sources can expose raw data coming from
 * hardware sensors on local or companion devices. They can also expose derived data, created by
 * transforming or merging other data sources. Multiple data sources can exist for the same data
 * type. Every data point inserted into or read from this service has an associated data source.
 *
 * The data source contains enough information to uniquely identify its data, including the hardware
 * device and the application that collected and/or transformed the data. It also holds useful
 * metadata, such as the hardware and application versions, and the device type.
 *
 * Each data source produces a unique stream of data, with a unique identifier. Not all changes to
 * data source affect the stream identifier, so that data collected by updated versions of the same
 * application/device can still be considered to belong to the same data stream.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Fitness. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
