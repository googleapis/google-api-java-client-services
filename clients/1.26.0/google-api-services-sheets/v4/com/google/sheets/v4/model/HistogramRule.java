/**
 * Allows you to organize the numeric values in a source data column into buckets of a constant
 * size. All values from HistogramRule.start to HistogramRule.end are placed into groups of size
 * HistogramRule.interval. In addition, all values below HistogramRule.start are placed in one
 * group, and all values above HistogramRule.end are placed in another. Only HistogramRule.interval
 * is required, though if HistogramRule.start and HistogramRule.end are both provided,
 * HistogramRule.start must be less than HistogramRule.end. For example, a pivot table showing
 * average purchase amount by age that has 50+ rows:
 *
 *     +-----+-------------------+     | Age | AVERAGE of Amount |     +-----+-------------------+
 * | 16  |            $27.13 |     | 17  |             $5.24 |     | 18  |            $20.15 |
 * ...     +-----+-------------------+ could be turned into a pivot table that looks like the one
 * below by applying a histogram group rule with a HistogramRule.start of 25, an
 * HistogramRule.interval of 20, and an HistogramRule.end of 65.
 *
 *     +-------------+-------------------+     | Grouped Age | AVERAGE of Amount |
 * +-------------+-------------------+     | < 25        |            $19.34 |     | 25-45       |
 * $31.43 |     | 45-65       |            $35.87 |     | > 65        |            $27.55 |
 * +-------------+-------------------+     | Grand Total |            $29.12 |
 * +-------------+-------------------+
