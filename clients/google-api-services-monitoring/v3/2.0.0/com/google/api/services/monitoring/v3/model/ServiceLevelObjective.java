/**
 * A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes a level of desired good service. It consists of a
 * service-level indicator (SLI), a performance goal, and a period over which the objective is to be
 * evaluated against that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners.
 * Typical SLOs might include "99% of requests in each rolling week have latency below 200
 * milliseconds" or "99.5% of requests in each calendar month return successfully."
 *
