/**
 * A bin is a discrete portion of data spanning from start to end, or if no end is given, then from
 * start to +inf. A bin's start and end values are given in the value type of the metric it
 * represents. For example, "first contentful paint" is measured in milliseconds and exposed as
 * ints, therefore its metric bins will use int32s for its start and end types. However, "cumulative
 * layout shift" is measured in unitless decimals and is exposed as a decimal encoded as a string,
 * therefore its metric bins will use strings for its value type.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
