Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds: {  value: 90,  category: 'DANGER',  trigger: 'ABOVE', }, {  value: 70,  category: 'WARNING',  trigger: 'ABOVE', }, {  value: 10,  category: 'DANGER',  trigger: 'BELOW', }, {  value: 20,  category: 'WARNING',  trigger: 'BELOW', }Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER state."

This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example \"the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster\". This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.
