It is used to\nspecify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.\n\n\nA `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of\n`members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,\nGoogle domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions\ndefined by IAM.\n\n**JSON Example**\n\n    {\n      \"bindings\": [\n        {\n          \"role\": \"roles/owner\",\n          \"members\": [\n            \"user:mike@example.com\",\n            \"group:admins@example.com\",\n            \"domain:google.com\",\n            \"serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"roles/viewer\",\n          \"members\": [\"user:sean@example.com\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n**YAML Example**\n\n    bindings:\n    - members:\n      - user:mike@example.com\n      - group:admins@example.com\n      - domain:google.com\n      - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\n      role: roles/owner\n    - members:\n      - user:sean@example.com\n      role: roles/viewer\n\n\nFor a description of IAM and its features, see the\n[IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs)."
