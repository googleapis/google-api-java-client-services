/**
 * The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming
 * environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc).
 * The error model is designed to be:
 *
 * - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *
 * # Overview
 *
 * The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
 * The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error
 * codes if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 * developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is
 * needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional
 * error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of
 * error detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
 *
 * # Language mapping
 *
 * The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily
 * the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and
 * different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to
 * some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *
 * # Other uses
 *
 * The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or
 * without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *
 * Example uses of this error model include:
 *
 * - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed the
 * `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.
 *
 * - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may     have a `Status`
 * message for error reporting.
 *
 * - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
 * should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-response.
 *
 * - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation     results in its
 * response, the status of those operations should be     represented directly using the `Status`
 * message.
 *
 * - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used directly
 * after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud IoT API. For a detailed explanation see:
