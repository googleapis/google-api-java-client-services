/**
 * Specifies a precalculated polyline from the [Routes
 * API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes) defining the route to search.
 * Searching along a route is similar to using the `locationBias` or `locationRestriction` request
 * option to bias the search results. However, while the `locationBias` and `locationRestriction`
 * options let you specify a region to bias the search results, this option lets you bias the
 * results along a trip route. Results are not guaranteed to be along the route provided, but rather
 * are ranked within the search area defined by the polyline and, optionally, by the `locationBias`
 * or `locationRestriction` based on minimal detour times from origin to destination. The results
 * might be along an alternate route, especially if the provided polyline does not define an optimal
 * route from origin to destination.
 *
