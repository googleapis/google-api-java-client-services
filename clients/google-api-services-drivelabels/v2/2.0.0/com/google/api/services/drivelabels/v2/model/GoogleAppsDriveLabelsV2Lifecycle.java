/**
 * The lifecycle state of an object, such as label, field, or choice. For more information, see
 * [Label lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/labels/guides/label-lifecycle).
 * The lifecycle enforces the following transitions: * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` (starting state) *
 * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -> `PUBLISHED` * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -> (Deleted) * `PUBLISHED` -> `DISABLED`
 * * `DISABLED` -> `PUBLISHED` * `DISABLED` -> (Deleted) The published and disabled states have some
 * distinct characteristics: * `Published`: Some kinds of changes might be made to an object in this
 * state, in which case `has_unpublished_changes` will be true. Also, some kinds of changes aren't
 * permitted. Generally, any change that would invalidate or cause new restrictions on existing
 * metadata related to the label are rejected. * `Disabled`: When disabled, the configured
 * `DisabledPolicy` takes effect.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Drive Labels API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
