For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

            "The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.
