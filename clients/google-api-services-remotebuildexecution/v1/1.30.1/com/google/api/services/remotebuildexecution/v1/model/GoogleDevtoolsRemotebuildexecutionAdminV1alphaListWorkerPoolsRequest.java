   * Optional. A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression
   * must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
   * filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. String values are case-
   * insensitive. The comparison operator must be either `:`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<=` or `<`. The
   * `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is
   * equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test  whether a key has been
   * defined.
   *
   * You can also filter on nested fields.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, you can separate expression using `AND` and `OR` operators,
   * using parentheses to specify precedence. If neither operator is specified, `AND` is assumed.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * Include only pools with more than 100 reserved workers: `(worker_count > 100)
   * (worker_config.reserved = true)`
   *
   * Include only pools with a certain label or machines of the n1-standard family:
   * `worker_config.labels.key1 : * OR worker_config.machine_type: n1-standard`
   * The value may be {@code null}.
