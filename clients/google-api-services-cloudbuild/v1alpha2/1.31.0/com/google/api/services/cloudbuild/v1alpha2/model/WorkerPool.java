 * Configuration for a WorkerPool to run the builds. Workers are machines that Cloud Build uses to
 * run your builds. By default, all workers run in a project owned by Cloud Build. To have full
 * control over the workers that execute your builds -- such as enabling them to access private
 * resources on your private network -- you can request Cloud Build to run the workers in your own
 * project by creating a custom workers pool.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
