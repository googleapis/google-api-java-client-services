   * A filtering expression to specify restrictions on returned events. The expression is a sequence
   * of terms. Each term applies a restriction to the returned user events. Use this expression to
   * restrict results to a specific time range or to filter events by eventType. For example,
   * `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventsMissingCatalogItems
   * eventTime<"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType=search` We expect only three types of fields: *
   * `eventTime`: This can be specified twice, once with a less than operator and once with a
   * greater than operator. The `eventTime` restriction should result in one, contiguous, valid,
   * `eventTime` range. * `eventType`: Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the
   * expression is enclosed in parentheses and the operators are separated from the tag values by a
   * space. * `eventsMissingCatalogItems`: This restricts results to events for which catalog items
   * were not found in the catalog. The default behavior is to return only those events for which
   * catalog items were found. Some examples of valid filters expressions: * Example 1: `eventTime >
   * "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"` * Example 2: `eventTime >
   * "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = detail-page-view` * Example 3:
   * `eventsMissingCatalogItems eventType = (NOT search) eventTime < "2018-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"` *
   * Example 4: `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"` * Example 5: `eventType = (detail-page-view
   * OR search)` * Example 6: `eventsMissingCatalogItems`
