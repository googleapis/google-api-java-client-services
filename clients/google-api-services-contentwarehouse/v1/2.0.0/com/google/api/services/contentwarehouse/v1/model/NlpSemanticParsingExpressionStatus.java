/**
 * Status indicating whether the user has finished expressing their intended semantics during a
 * streaming interaction. Semantics are partially expressed when later, unprompted user input is
 * expected to modify the semantics. Future inputs are typically additional speech or continued
 * modification of argument text in form field. These inputs can trigger modifications including
 * adding arguments, changing the intent, or modifying existing arguments. Sensing this status can
 * be done both directly and indirectly. Fluid Actions directly detects this status as the user
 * moves between, or enters and leaves, argument form fields. Understanding indirectly detects this
 * status by the pace of the user's speech, the semantics of the language, and the user's
 * intonation. See go/streaming-nlu-fulfilment-protocol-v1 for details about how it is used in the
 * Streaming NLU Fulfillment protocol.
