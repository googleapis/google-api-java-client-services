/**
 * Singleton resource representing the set of Excessive Weakeups metrics. This metric set contains
 * AlarmManager wakeup counts data combined with process state data to produce a normalized metric
 * independent of user counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in
 * calendar date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is
 * `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `excessiveWakeupRate` (`google.type.Decimal`):
 * Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that had more than 10 wakeups per hour. If
 * your app exhibits an excessive wakeup rate equal to or higher than the threshold, it's in the
 * bottom 25% of the top 1,000 apps on Google Play (by number of installs). *
 * `excessiveWakeupRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of
 * `excessiveWakeupRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct
 * users for the day. * `excessiveWakeupRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling
 * average value of `excessiveWakeupRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the
 * count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct
 * users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the
 * `excessiveWakeupRate` metric. A user is counted in this metric if they app was doing any work on
 * the device, i.e., not just active foreground usage but also background work. Care must be taken
 * not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times.
 * **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the
 * user's device. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device.
 * * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. * `deviceType` (string):
 * the type (also known as form factor) of the user's device. * `countryCode` (string): the country
 * or region of the user's device based on their IP address, represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code
 * (e.g. US for the United States). **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling
 * user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app.
 *
