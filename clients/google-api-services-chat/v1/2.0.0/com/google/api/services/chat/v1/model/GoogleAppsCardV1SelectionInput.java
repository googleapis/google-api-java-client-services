/**
 * A widget that creates a UI item with options for users to select. For example, a dropdown menu or
 * check list. Chat apps receive and can process the value of entered text during form input events.
 * For details about working with form inputs, see [Receive form
 * data](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs#receive_form_data_from_dialogs). When
 * you need to collect data from users that matches options you set, use a selection input. To
 * collect abstract data from users, use the text input widget instead. Only supported in
 * [dialogs](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). Support for [card
 * messages](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/message-formats/cards) coming soon.
 *
