/**
 * Allows you to organize the date-time values in a source data column into buckets based on
 * selected parts of their date or time values. For example, consider a pivot table showing sales
 * transactions by date:
 *
 *     +----------+--------------+     | Date     | SUM of Sales |     +----------+--------------+
 * | 1/1/2017 |      $621.14 |     | 2/3/2017 |      $708.84 |     | 5/8/2017 |      $326.84 |
 * ...     +----------+--------------+ Applying a date-time group rule with a DateTimeRuleType of
 * YEAR_MONTH results in the following pivot table.
 *
 *     +--------------+--------------+     | Grouped Date | SUM of Sales |
 * +--------------+--------------+     | 2017-Jan     |   $53,731.78 |     | 2017-Feb     |
 * $83,475.32 |     | 2017-Mar     |   $94,385.05 |     ...     +--------------+--------------+
