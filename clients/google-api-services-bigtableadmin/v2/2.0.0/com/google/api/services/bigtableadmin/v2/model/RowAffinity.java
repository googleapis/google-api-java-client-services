 * If enabled, the AFE will route the request based on the row key of the request, rather than
 * randomly. Instead, each row key will be assigned to a cluster, and will stick to that cluster. If
 * clusters are added or removed, then this may affect which row keys stick to which clusters. To
 * avoid this, users can specify a group cluster.
