/**
 * A representation of an execution of an Apps Script function started with run. The execution
 * response does not arrive until the function finishes executing. The maximum execution runtime is
 * listed in the [Apps Script quotas guide](/apps-
 * script/guides/services/quotas#current_limitations). After execution has started, it can have one
 * of four outcomes:   If the script function returns successfully, the   response field contains an
 * ExecutionResponse object   with the function's return value in the object's `result` field.  If
 * the script function (or Apps Script itself) throws an exception, the   error field contains a
 * Status object. The `Status` object's `details`   field contains an array with a single
 * ExecutionError object that   provides information about the nature of the error.  If the
 * execution has not yet completed,   the done field is `false` and   the neither the `response` nor
 * `error` fields are present.  If the `run` call itself fails (for example, because of a
 * malformed request or an authorization error), the method returns an HTTP   response code in the
 * 4XX range with a different format for the response   body. Client libraries automatically convert
 * a 4XX response into an   exception class.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Apps Script API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
