/**
 * An unique identification of a chain. The following are the possible chain id forms: 1)
 * prominent_entity_id only: The entity uniquely represents a chain, which may have multiple
 * sitechunks. 2) sitechunk only: The sitechunk uniquely represents a chain while the chain
 * currently does not have an entity in KG. 3) prominent_entity_id + sitechunk: The chain could be
 * represented by the entity, but not merged at last, and the sitechunks represents the chain
 * better. 4) prominent_entity_id + category: There are multiple subchains for the prominent entity,
 * and category is used to differentiate subchains. NOTE: the size and complexity of the ChainId
 * proto has implications in the serving system and should be thoughtfully kept under control.
