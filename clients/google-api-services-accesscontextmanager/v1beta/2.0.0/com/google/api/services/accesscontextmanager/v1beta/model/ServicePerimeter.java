/**
 * `ServicePerimeter` describes a set of Google Cloud resources which can freely import and export
 * data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the `ServicePerimeter`. If a request with a
 * source within this `ServicePerimeter` has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request
 * will be blocked. Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter -
 * Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single Google Cloud project can
 * only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service Perimeter Bridges can contain only
 * Google Cloud projects as members, a single Google Cloud project may belong to multiple Service
 * Perimeter Bridges.
