/**
 * A Case is an object that contains the details of a support case. It contains fields for the time
 * it was created, its priority, its classification, and more. Cases can also have comments and
 * attachments that get added over time. A case is parented by a Google Cloud organization or
 * project. Organizations are identified by a number, so the name of a case parented by an
 * organization would look like this: ``` organizations/123/cases/456 ``` Projects have two unique
 * identifiers, an ID and a number, and they look like this: ``` projects/abc/cases/456 ``` ```
 * projects/123/cases/456 ``` You can use either of them when calling the API. To learn more about
 * project identifiers, see [AIP-2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510).
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
