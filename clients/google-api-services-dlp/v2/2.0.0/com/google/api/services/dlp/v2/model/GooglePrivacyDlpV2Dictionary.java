/**
 * Custom information type based on a dictionary of words or phrases. This can be used to match
 * sensitive information specific to the data, such as a list of employee IDs or job titles.
 * Dictionary words are case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the
 * unicode [Basic Multilingual
 * Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) will be
 * replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the dictionary phrase "Sam Johnson" will
 * match all three phrases "sam johnson", "Sam, Johnson", and "Sam (Johnson)". Additionally, the
 * characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within
 * the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the
 * dictionary word "jen" will match the first three letters of the text "jen123" but will return no
 * matches for "jennifer". Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not
 * letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as
 * whitespace. The [limits](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/limits) page contains details about the
 * size limits of dictionaries. For dictionaries that do not fit within these constraints, consider
 * using `LargeCustomDictionaryConfig` in the `StoredInfoType` API.
 *
