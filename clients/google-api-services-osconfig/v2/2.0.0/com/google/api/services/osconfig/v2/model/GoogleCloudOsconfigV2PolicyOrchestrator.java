/**
 * PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g. OS Policy
 * Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them across projects and locations,
 * at scale. Policy orchestrator functions as an endless loop. Each iteration orchestrator computes
 * a set of resources that should be affected, then progressively applies changes to them. If for
 * some reason this set of resources changes over time (e.g. new projects are added), the future
 * loop iterations will address that. Orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For
 * more details, see the description of the `action`, and `orchestrated_resource` fields. Note that
 * policy orchestrator do not "manage" the resources it creates. Every iteration is independent and
 * only minimal history of past actions is retained (apart from Cloud Logging). If orchestrator gets
 * deleted, it does not affect the resources it created in the past. Those will remain where they
 * were. Same applies if projects are removed from the orchestrator's scope.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the OS Config API. For a detailed explanation see:
