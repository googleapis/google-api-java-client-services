   * The payload for the command, provide it only if command supports it. The following commands
   * support adding payload: * `SET_VOLUME`: Payload is a stringified JSON object in the form: {
   * "volume": 50 }. The volume has to be an integer in the range [0,100]. *
   * `DEVICE_START_CRD_SESSION`: Payload is optionally a stringified JSON object in the form: {
   * "ackedUserPresence": true, "crdSessionType": string }. `ackedUserPresence` is a boolean. By
   * default, `ackedUserPresence` is set to `false`. To start a Chrome Remote Desktop session for an
   * active device, set `ackedUserPresence` to `true`. `crdSessionType` can only select from values
   * `private` (which grants the remote admin exclusive control of the ChromeOS device) or `shared`
   * (which allows the admin and the local user to share control of the ChromeOS device). If not
   * set, `crdSessionType` defaults to `shared`. * `REBOOT`: Payload is a stringified JSON object in
   * the form: { "user_session_delay_seconds": 300 }. The `user_session_delay_seconds` is the amount
   * of seconds to wait before rebooting the device if a user is logged in. It has to be an integer
   * in the range [0,300]. When payload is not present for reboot, 0 delay is the default. Note:
   * This only applies if an actual user is logged in, including a Guest. If the device is in the
   * login screen or in Kiosk mode the value is not respected and the device immediately reboots. *
   * `FETCH_SUPPORT_PACKET`: Payload is optionally a stringified JSON object in the form:
   * {"supportPacketDetails":{ "issueCaseId": optional_support_case_id_string, "issueDescription":
   * optional_issue_description_string, "requestedDataCollectors": []}} The list of available
   * `data_collector_enums` are as following: Chrome System Information (1), Crash IDs (2), Memory
   * Details (3), UI Hierarchy (4), Additional ChromeOS Platform Logs (5), Device Event (6), Intel
   * WiFi NICs Debug Dump (7), Touch Events (8), Lacros (9), Lacros System Information (10),
   * ChromeOS Flex Logs (11), DBus Details (12), ChromeOS Network Routes (13), ChromeOS Shill
   * (Connection Manager) Logs (14), Policies (15), ChromeOS System State and Logs (16), ChromeOS
   * System Logs (17), ChromeOS Chrome User Logs (18), ChromeOS Bluetooth (19), ChromeOS Connected
