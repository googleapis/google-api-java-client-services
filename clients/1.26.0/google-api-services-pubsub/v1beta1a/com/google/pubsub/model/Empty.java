/**
 * An empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your project.
 * A typical example is to use it as argument or the return value of a service API. For instance:
 *
 *   service Foo {     rpc Bar (proto2.Empty) returns (proto2.Empty) { };   };
 *
 * BEGIN GOOGLE-INTERNAL The difference between this one and net/rpc/empty-message.proto is that 1)
 * The generated message here is in proto2 C++ API. 2) The proto2.Empty has minimum dependencies
 * (no message_set or net/rpc dependencies) END GOOGLE-INTERNAL
 *
