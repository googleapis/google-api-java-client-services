/**
 * Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource.
 *
 * `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy
 * (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the
 * `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional
 * `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix
 * is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a ":". Values
 * prefixed with "is:" are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in
 * one of the following formats:     - “projects/”, e.g. “projects/tokyo-rain-123”     - “folders/”,
 * e.g. “folders/1234”     - “organizations/”, e.g. “organizations/1234” The `supports_under` field
 * of the associated `Constraint`  defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set
 * `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is
 * `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values`
 * is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Asset API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>

   * Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.
   *
   * By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supercedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the
   * resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from
   * the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this
   * `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
   *
   * Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't
   * recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However,
   * it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with
   * `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
   * not present in `denied_values`.
   *
   * For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a
   * `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose
   * that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API
   * activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization
   * that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt
   * to activate any API will be denied.
   *
   * The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by
   * `organizations/foo`:
   *
   * Example 1 (no inherited values):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}   `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false`
   * and values:     {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"} The accepted values at
   * `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.
   *
   * Example 2 (inherited values):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {value: “E3” value: ”E4” inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo`
   * are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.
   *
   * Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
   * with values:     {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy`
   * with:     {denied_values: "E1"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The
   * value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.
   *
   * Example 4 (RestoreDefault):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted
   * values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default`
   * (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none).
   *
   * Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):   `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.
   * `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none
   * depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none).
   *
   * Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values: ”E2”}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:     {all:
   * ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at
   * `projects/bar`.
   *
   * Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
   * {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values: ”E2”}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:     {all:
   * DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at
   * `projects/bar`.
   *
   * Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following
   * resource hierarchy   O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3},   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
   * with values:     {allowed_values: "under:organizations/O1"}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy`
   * with:     {allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"}     {denied_values: "under:folders/F2"} The
