 * This is the category that a user picked this job type from at the time of input. The field serves
 * two purposes: 1) The name is used in consumer surface similar to the heading name today (i.e.,
 * grouping jobs under the category. 2) The gcid is needed mainly for free-formed entries, for which
 * GMB needs to map them to corresponding categories in the frontend, if applicable. Notice that the
 * name and the id are both not expected to be in sync with gcid deprecation or location category
 * change per product decision. In other words, they are not guaranteed to stay in sync, only
 * guaranteed true at time of creation.
