/**
 * Enqueues the given DDL statements to be applied, in order but not necessarily all at once, to the
 * database schema at some point (or points) in the future. The server checks that the statements
 * are executable (syntactically valid, name tables that exist, etc.) before enqueueing them, but
 * they may still fail upon later execution (e.g., if a statement from another batch of statements
 * is applied first and it conflicts in some way, or if there is some data-related problem like a
 * `NULL` value in a column to which `NOT NULL` would be added). If a statement fails, all
 * subsequent statements in the batch are automatically cancelled.
 *
 * Each batch of statements is assigned a name which can be used with the Operations API to monitor
 * progress. See the operation_id field for more details.
