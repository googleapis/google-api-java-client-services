They can\nalso expose derived data, created by transforming or merging other data\nsources. Multiple data sources can exist for the same data type. Every data\npoint inserted into or read from this service has an associated data\nsource.\n\nThe data source contains enough information to uniquely identify its data,\nincluding the hardware device and the application that collected and/or\ntransformed the data. It also holds useful metadata, such as the hardware and\napplication versions, and the device type.\n\nEach data source produces a unique stream of data, with a unique identifier.\nNot all changes to data source affect the stream identifier, so that data\ncollected by updated versions of the same application/device can still be\nconsidered to belong to the same data stream."
