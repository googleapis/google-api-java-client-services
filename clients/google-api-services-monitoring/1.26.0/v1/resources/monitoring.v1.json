      "description": "The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\nSimple to use and understand for most users\nFlexible enough to meet unexpected needsOverviewThe Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers understand and resolve the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package google.rpc that can be used for common error conditions.Language mappingThe Status message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the Status message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.Other usesThe error model and the Status message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.Example uses of this error model include:\nPartial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the Status in the normal response to indicate the partial errors.\nWorkflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a Status message for error reporting.\nBatch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the Status message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response.\nAsynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the Status message.\nLogging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message Status could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",
