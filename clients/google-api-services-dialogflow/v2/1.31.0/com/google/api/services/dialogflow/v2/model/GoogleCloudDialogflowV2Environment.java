/**
 * You can create multiple versions of your agent and publish them to separate environments. When
 * you edit an agent, you are editing the draft agent. At any point, you can save the draft agent as
 * an agent version, which is an immutable snapshot of your agent. When you save the draft agent, it
 * is published to the default environment. When you create agent versions, you can publish them to
 * custom environments. You can create a variety of custom environments for: - testing - development
 * - production - etc. For more information, see the [versions and environments
 * guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-versions).
