/**
 * Response for GenerateDeployChangeReport and GenerateUndeployChangeReport. This report contains
 * any validation failures that would cause the deployment to be rejected, as well changes and
 * conflicts in routing that may occur due to the new deployment. The existence of a routing warning
 * does not necessarily imply that the deployment request is bad, if the desired state of the
 * deployment request is to effect a routing change. The primary purposes of the routing messages
 * are: 1) To inform users of routing changes that may have an effect on traffic currently being
 * routed to other existing deployments. 2) To warn users if some base path in the proxy will not
 * receive traffic due to an existing deployment having already claimed that base path. The presence
 * of routing conflicts/changes will not cause non-dry-run DeployApiProxy/UndeployApiProxy requests
 * to be rejected.
 *
