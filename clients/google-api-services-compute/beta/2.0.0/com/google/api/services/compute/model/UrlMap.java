/**
 * Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: *
 * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/urlMaps) *
 * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of
 * certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external
 * Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal
 * Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers,
 * regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers.
 * For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing
 * features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for
 * Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This
 * resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend
 * bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme
 * of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend
 * service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map
 * Concepts.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Compute Engine API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
