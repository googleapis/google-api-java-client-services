/**
 * A time zone. Conceptually, a time zone is a set of rules associated with a location that
 * describes a UTC offset and how it changes over time (e.g. Daylight Saving Time). The offset is
 * used to compute the local date and time. IMPORTANT: The definition of TimeZone enum is being
 * moved to //assistant/api/core_types/governed/datetime_type.proto. All existing references will be
 * updated to point to the new location. If you are adding a reference, use the new one instead.
