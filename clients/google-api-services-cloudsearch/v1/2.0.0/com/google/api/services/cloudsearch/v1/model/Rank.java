 * The rank contains a tuple of numbers which may be used as a general sort order. The rank should
 * be treated as an ordered set of numbers, where the ordering is done in descending order of the
 * most significant rank member. For example, given the following ranks described as (primary,
 * secondary): (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) (2,1) The descending rank-order is: (2,2) > (2,1) > (1,2) > (1,1)
