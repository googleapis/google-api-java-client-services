/**
 * Auto scaling settings. max_slots and budget are mutually exclusive. If max_slots is set: * The
 * system will create a dedicated `FLEX` capacity commitment to hold the slots for auto-scale. Users
 * won't be able to manage it, to avoid conflicts. * Scale-up will happen if there are always
 * pending tasks for the past 10 minutes. * Scale-down will happen, if the system detects that
 * scale-up won't be triggered again. If budget is set: * The system will try to use more slots
 * immediately. * At a particular moment, the number of slots scaled is determined by the sytsem,
 * based on the remaining budget and system limit. But overall the usage will conform to the budget
 * if there is enough traffic. * The system will round the slot usage every minute. **Note** this is
 * an alpha feature.
