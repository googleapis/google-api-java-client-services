/**
 * Suggested values that users can enter. These values appear when users click inside the text input
 * field. As users type, the suggested values dynamically filter to match what the users have typed.
 * For example, a text input field for programming language might suggest Java, JavaScript, Python,
 * and C++. When users start typing `Jav`, the list of suggestions filters to show `Java` and
 * `JavaScript`. Suggested values help guide users to enter values that your app can make sense of.
 * When referring to JavaScript, some users might enter `javascript` and others `java script`.
 * Suggesting `JavaScript` can standardize how users interact with your app. When specified,
 * `TextInput.type` is always `SINGLE_LINE`, even if it's set to `MULTIPLE_LINE`. [Google Workspace
