 * The directed read replica selector. Callers must provide one or more of the following fields for
 * replica selection: * `location` - The location must be one of the regions within the multi-region
 * configuration of your database. * `type` - The type of the replica. Some examples of using
 * replica_selectors are: * `location:us-east1` --> The "us-east1" replica(s) of any available type
 * is used to process the request. * `type:READ_ONLY` --> The "READ_ONLY" type replica(s) in the
 * nearest available location are used to process the request. * `location:us-east1 type:READ_ONLY`
 * --> The "READ_ONLY" type replica(s) in location "us-east1" is used to process the request.
