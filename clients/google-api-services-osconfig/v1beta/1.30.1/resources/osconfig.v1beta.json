VMs that\nare not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this\ndisruption budget.\n\nFor zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded,\nthe patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires\ncompletion of the patch process in the previous zone.\n\nFor example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs\nfail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs\nat a time until the zone is completed.
