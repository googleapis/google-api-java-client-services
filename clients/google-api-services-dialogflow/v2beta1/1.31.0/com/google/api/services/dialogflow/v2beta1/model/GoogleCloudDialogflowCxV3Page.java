/**
 * A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized as a state machine. The
 * states of a CX session are represented by pages. For each flow, you define many pages, where your
 * combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for. At any
 * given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and
 * the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page.
 * When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each
 * conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page.
 * You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the
 * conversational state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page
 * guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Dialogflow API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
