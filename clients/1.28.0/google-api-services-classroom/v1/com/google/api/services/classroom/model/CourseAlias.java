/**
 * Alternative identifier for a course.
 *
 * An alias uniquely identifies a course. It must be unique within one of the following scopes:
 *
 * * domain: A domain-scoped alias is visible to all users within the alias creator's domain and can
 * be created only by a domain admin. A domain-scoped alias is often used when a course has an
 * identifier external to Classroom.
 *
 * * project: A project-scoped alias is visible to any request from an application using the
 * Developer Console project ID that created the alias and can be created by any project. A project-
 * scoped alias is often used when an application has alternative identifiers. A random value can
 * also be used to avoid duplicate courses in the event of transmission failures, as retrying a
 * request will return `ALREADY_EXISTS` if a previous one has succeeded.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
