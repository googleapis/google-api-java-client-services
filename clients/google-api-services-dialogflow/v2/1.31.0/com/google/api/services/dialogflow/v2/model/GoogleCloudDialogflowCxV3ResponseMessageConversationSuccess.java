 * Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer
 * talked to it about. Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted
 * as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow
 * also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they
 * don't return ConversationSuccess. You may set this, for example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a
 * Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded. * In a webhook response when
 * you determine that you handled the customer issue.
