/**
 * *Deprecated:* New integrations cannot use this method and can refer to our new recommendations.
 * The presence of an Entitlements resource indicates that a user has the right to use a particular
 * app. Entitlements are user specific, not device specific. This allows a user with an entitlement
 * to an app to install the app on all their devices. It's also possible for a user to hold an
 * entitlement to an app without installing the app on any device. The API can be used to create an
 * entitlement. As an option, you can also use the API to trigger the installation of an app on all
 * a user's managed devices at the same time the entitlement is created. If the app is free,
 * creating the entitlement also creates a group license for that app. For paid apps, creating the
 * entitlement consumes one license, and that license remains consumed until the entitlement is
 * removed. If the enterprise hasn't purchased enough licenses, then no entitlement is created and
 * the installation fails. An entitlement is also not created for an app if the app requires
 * permissions that the enterprise hasn't accepted. If an entitlement is deleted, the app may be
 * uninstalled from a user's device. As a best practice, uninstall the app by calling
 * Installs.delete() before deleting the entitlement. Entitlements for apps that a user pays for on
 * an unmanaged profile have "userPurchase" as the entitlement reason. These entitlements cannot be
 * removed via the API.
