/**
 * An Attachment contains metadata about a file that was uploaded to a case - it is NOT a file
 * itself. That being said, the name of an Attachment object can be used to download its
 * accompanying file through the `media.download` endpoint. While attachments can be uploaded in the
 * console at the same time as a comment, they're associated on a "case" level, not a "comment"
 * level.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Google Cloud Support API. For a detailed explanation
 * see:
