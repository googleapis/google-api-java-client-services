      "description": "Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to\nspecify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.\n\n\nA `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more\n`members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,\nGoogle groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of\npermissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A `binding` can\noptionally specify a `condition`, which is a logic expression that further\nconstrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or\ntarget resource.\n\n**JSON Example**\n\n    {\n      \"bindings\": [\n        {\n          \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\",\n          \"members\": [\n            \"user:mike@example.com\",\n            \"group:admins@example.com\",\n            \"domain:google.com\",\n            \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\",\n          \"members\": [\"user:eve@example.com\"],\n          \"condition\": {\n            \"title\": \"expirable access\",\n            \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\",\n            \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c\n            timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\",\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n**YAML Example**\n\n    bindings:\n    - members:\n      - user:mike@example.com\n      - group:admins@example.com\n      - domain:google.com\n      - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\n      role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\n    - members:\n      - user:eve@example.com\n      role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\n      condition:\n        title: expirable access\n        description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020\n        expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\n\nFor a description of IAM and its features, see the\n[IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).",
