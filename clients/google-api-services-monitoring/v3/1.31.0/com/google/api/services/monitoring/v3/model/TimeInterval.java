/**
 * Describes a time interval: Reads: A half-open time interval. It includes the end time but
 * excludes the start time: (startTime, endTime]. The start time must be specified, must be earlier
 * than the end time, and should be no older than the data retention period for the metric. Writes:
 * A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both:
 * [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind
 * (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricKind) of
 * the metric value. The end time must not be earlier than the start time, and the end time must not
 * be more than 25 hours in the past or more than five minutes in the future. For GAUGE metrics, the
 * startTime value is technically optional; if no value is specified, the start time defaults to the
 * value of the end time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both start and end
 * times are specified, they must be identical. Such an interval is valid only for GAUGE metrics,
 * which are point-in-time measurements. The end time of a new interval must be at least a
 * millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For DELTA metrics, the start time and
 * end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying contiguous and non-
 * overlapping intervals. For DELTA metrics, the start time of the next interval must be at least a
 * millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For CUMULATIVE metrics, the start time
 * and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying the same start
 * time and increasing end times, until an event resets the cumulative value to zero and sets a new
 * start time for the following points. The new start time must be at least a millisecond after the
 * end time of the previous interval. The start time of a new interval must be at least a
 * millisecond after the end time of the previous interval because intervals are closed. If the
 * start time of a new interval is the same as the end time of the previous interval, then data
 * written at the new start time could overwrite data written at the previous end time.
