/**
 * A phrases containing words and phrase "hints" so that the speech recognition is more likely to
 * recognize them. This can be used to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for
 * example, if specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be used to add
 * additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com
 * /speech-to-text/quotas#content). List items can also include pre-built or custom classes
 * containing groups of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural language. For
 * example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the year (e.g. "i was born in
 * january", "i was born in febuary", ...), use the pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood
 * of correctly transcribing audio that includes months (e.g. "i was born in $month"). To refer to
 * pre-built classes, use the class' symbol prepended with `$` e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom
 * classes that were defined inline in the request, set the class's `custom_class_id` to a string
 * unique to all class resources and inline classes. Then use the class' id wrapped in $`{...}` e.g.
 * "${my-months}". To refer to custom classes resources, use the class' id wrapped in `${}` (e.g.
 * `${my-months}`). Speech-to-Text supports three locations: `global`, `us` (US North America), and
 * `eu` (Europe). If you are calling the `speech.googleapis.com` endpoint, use the `global`
 * location. To specify a region, use a [regional endpoint](/speech-to-text/docs/endpoints) with
 * matching `us` or `eu` location value.
