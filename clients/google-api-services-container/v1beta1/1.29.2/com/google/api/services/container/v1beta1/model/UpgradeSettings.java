/**
 * These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of disruption caused by an
 * upgrade.
 *
 * maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable.
 *
 * maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily
 * for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes.
 *
 * (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being
 * upgraded at the same time).
 *
 * Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old
 * nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within
 * the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.)
 *
 * Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means
 * the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes,
 * then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that there are
 * always at least 4 nodes available.
 *
