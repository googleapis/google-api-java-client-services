/**
 * The request to run a pipeline. If `pipelineId` is specified, it refers to a saved pipeline
 * created with CreatePipeline and set as the `pipelineId` of the returned Pipeline object. If
 * `ephemeralPipeline` is specified, that pipeline is run once with the given args and not saved. It
 * is an error to specify both `pipelineId` and `ephemeralPipeline`. `pipelineArgs` must be
 * specified.
