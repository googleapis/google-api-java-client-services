/**
 * ThresholdRule contains a definition of a threshold which triggers an alert (a notification of a
 * threshold being crossed) to be sent when spend goes above the specified amount. Alerts are
 * automatically e-mailed to users with the Billing Account Administrator role or the Billing
 * Account User role. The thresholds here have no effect on notifications sent to anything
 * configured under `Budget.all_updates_rule`.
 *
