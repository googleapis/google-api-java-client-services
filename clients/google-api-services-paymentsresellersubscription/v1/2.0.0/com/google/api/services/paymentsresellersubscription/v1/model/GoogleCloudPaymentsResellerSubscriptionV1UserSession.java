/**
 * A user session contains a short-lived token that includes information required to interact with
 * Google Payments Reseller Platform using the following web endpoints. - A user session token
 * should be generated dynamically for an authenticated user. You should refrain from sharing a
 * token directly with a user in an unauthenticated context, such as SMS, or email. - You can re-
 * generate new session tokens repeatedly for same `generate` request if necessary, regardless of
 * the previous tokens being expired or not. You don't need to worry about multiple sessions
 * resulting in duplicate fulfillments as guaranteed by the same subscription id. Please refer to
 * the [Google Managed Signup](/payments/reseller/subscription/reference/index/User.Signup.Integrati
 * on/Google.Managed.Signup.\(In.Preview\)) documentation for additional integration details.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Payments Reseller Subscription API. For a detailed
 * explanation see:
