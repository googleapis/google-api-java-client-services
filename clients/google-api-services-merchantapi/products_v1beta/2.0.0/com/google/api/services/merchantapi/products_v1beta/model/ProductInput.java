/**
 * This resource represents input data you submit for a product, not the processed product that you
 * see in Merchant Center, in Shopping ads, or across Google surfaces. Product inputs, rules and
 * supplemental data source data are combined to create the processed Product. For more information,
 * see [Manage products](/merchant/api/guides/products/overview). Required product input attributes
 * to pass data validation checks are primarily defined in the [Products Data
 * Specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494). The following attributes are
 * required: feedLabel, contentLanguage and offerId. After inserting, updating, or deleting a
 * product input, it may take several minutes before the processed product can be retrieved. All
 * fields in the product input and its sub-messages match the English name of their corresponding
 * attribute in the [Products Data
 * Specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494) with [some
 * exceptions](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112). The following reference
 * documentation lists the field names in the **camelCase** casing style while the Products Data
 * Specification lists the names in the **snake_case** casing style.
