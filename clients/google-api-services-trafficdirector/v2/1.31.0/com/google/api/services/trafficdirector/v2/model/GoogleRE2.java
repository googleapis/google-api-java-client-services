/**
 * Google's `RE2 `_ regex engine. The regex string must adhere to the documented `syntax `_. The
 * engine is designed to complete execution in linear time as well as limit the amount of memory
 * used. Envoy supports program size checking via runtime. The runtime keys
 * `re2.max_program_size.error_level` and `re2.max_program_size.warn_level` can be set to integers
 * as the maximum program size or complexity that a compiled regex can have before an exception is
 * thrown or a warning is logged, respectively. `re2.max_program_size.error_level` defaults to 100,
 * and `re2.max_program_size.warn_level` has no default if unset (will not check/log a warning).
 * Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size of regexes: the histogram `re2.program_size`,
 * which records the program size, and the counter `re2.exceeded_warn_level`, which is incremented
 * each time the program size exceeds the warn level threshold.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Traffic Director API. For a detailed explanation see:
