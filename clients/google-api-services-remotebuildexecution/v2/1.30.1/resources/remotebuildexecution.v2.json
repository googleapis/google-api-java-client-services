Technically, the server could\nimplement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more\ncomplicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size\nup-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where\ndigests are embedded).

      "description": "A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or\nmore children FileNodes,\nDirectoryNodes and\nSymlinkNodes.\nEach `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its\ncontent (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as\nwell as possibly some metadata about the file or directory.\n\nIn order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same\nvalue, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a\na `Directory`:\n\n* Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.\n  Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed.\n* Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name).\n  Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where\n  the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is\n  legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as\n  children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon\n  execution.\n* The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted\n  in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code\n  point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.\n* The NodeProperties of files,\n  directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by\n  property name.\n\nA `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.\n\nAs an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a\ndirectory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened\nfor readability):\n\n```json\n// (Directory proto)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"bar\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\",\n        size: 65534\n      },\n      node_properties: [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"MTime\",\n          \"value\": \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  directories: [\n    {\n      name: \"foo\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4cf2eda940...\",\n        size: 43\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"baz\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"b2c941073e...\",\n        size: 1294,\n      },\n      is_executable: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

The server MAY\nenforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is\nreceived. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the\nrequirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not\nverify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from\nanother logically equivalent action if they hash differently.\n\nReturns a stream of\ngoogle.longrunning.Operation messages\ndescribing the resulting execution, with eventual `response`\nExecuteResponse. The\n`metadata` on the operation is of type\nExecuteOperationMetadata.\n\nIf the client remains connected after the first response is returned after\nthe server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called\nWaitExecution\nuntil the execution completes or the request reaches an error.
