/**
 * Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational agent. Response messages
 * are also used for output audio synthesis. The approach is as follows: * If at least one
 * OutputAudioText response is present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly
 * concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the OutputAudioText
 * responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the concatenated result is treated as SSML;
 * otherwise, the result is treated as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should
 * ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text
 * responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. This
 * approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the
 * user may differ from what is heard.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
