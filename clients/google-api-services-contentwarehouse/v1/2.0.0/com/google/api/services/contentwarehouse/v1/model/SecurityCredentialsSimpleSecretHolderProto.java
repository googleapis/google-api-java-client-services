/**
 * Represents a principal which possesses a particular, presumably secret, string. Useful for things
 * like "auth keys," used for anonymous sharing. Since representing this principal with the actual
 * secret included reveals the secret, it's best if the requisite condition is enforced in some
 * other way, for example via Keystore wrapping attributes (Keystore will unwrap only if the
 * specified secret, aka "attribute", is presented). All that's stored here is an identifying label.
