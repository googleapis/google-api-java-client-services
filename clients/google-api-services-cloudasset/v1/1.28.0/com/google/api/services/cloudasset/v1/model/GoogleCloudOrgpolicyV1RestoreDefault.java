 * Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the `constraint_default` enforcement
 * behavior of the specific `Constraint` at this resource.
 *
 * Suppose that `constraint_default` is set to `ALLOW` for the `Constraint`
 * `constraints/serviceuser.services`. Suppose that organization foo.com sets a `Policy` at their
 * Organization resource node that restricts the allowed service activations to deny all service
 * activations. They could then set a `Policy` with the `policy_type` `restore_default` on several
 * experimental projects, restoring the `constraint_default` enforcement of the `Constraint` for
 * only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated.
