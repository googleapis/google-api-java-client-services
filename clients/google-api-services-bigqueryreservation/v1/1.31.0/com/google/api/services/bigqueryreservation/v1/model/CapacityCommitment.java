/**
 * Capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs (in the form of
 * slots) with some committed period of usage. Annual commitments renew by default. Commitments can
 * be removed after their commitment end time passes. In order to remove annual commitment, its plan
 * needs to be changed to monthly or flex first. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child
 * resource of the admin project.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the BigQuery Reservation API. For a detailed explanation
 * see:
