/**
 * A logical border is a grouping of border features, which together model a divide between two
 * regions. The borders within this grouping share common attributes, such as the regions they
 * divide, and may represent a conceptual group of borders, of which may be wholly disputed, wholly
 * undisputed, or a mixture of disputed and undisputed. Note that any borders within this group may
 * be part of multiple logical borders. A logical border is required to have a name describing what
 * the grouping represents (e.g. "US - Mexico Border", "Kosovo - Serbia Border (Disputed)").
