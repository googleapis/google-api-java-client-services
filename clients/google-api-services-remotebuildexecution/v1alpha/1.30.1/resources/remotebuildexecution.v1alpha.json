The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields."

Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files, directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by property name.

For each output directory requested in the `output_directories` or `output_paths` field of the Action, if the corresponding directory existed after the action completed, a single entry will be present in the output list, which will contain the digest of a Tree message containing the directory tree, and the path equal exactly to the corresponding Action output_directories member. As an example, suppose the Action had an output directory `a/b/dir` and the execution produced the following contents in `a/b/dir`: a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz`. Then, output_directory will contain (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // OutputDirectory proto: { path: \"a/b/dir\" tree_digest: { hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\", size: 55 } } // Tree proto with hash \"4a73bc9d03...\" and size 55: { root: { files: [ { name: \"bar\", digest: { hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\", size: 65534 } } ], directories: [ { name: \"foo\", digest: { hash: \"4cf2eda940...\", size: 43 } } ] } children : { // (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43) files: [ { name: \"baz\", digest: { hash: \"b2c941073e...\", size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } } ``` If an output of the same name as listed in `output_files` of the Command was found in `output_directories`, but was not a directory, the server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION.",
