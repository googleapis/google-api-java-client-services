/**
 * Defines a particular step within a Cloud Dataflow job.
 *
 * A job consists of multiple steps, each of which performs some specific operation as part of the
 * overall job.  Data is typically passed from one step to another as part of the job.
 *
 * Here's an example of a sequence of steps which together implement a Map-Reduce job:
 *
 *   * Read a collection of data from some source, parsing the     collection's elements.
 *
 *   * Validate the elements.
 *
 *   * Apply a user-defined function to map each element to some value     and extract an element-
 * specific key value.
 *
 *   * Group elements with the same key into a single element with     that key, transforming a
 * multiply-keyed collection into a     uniquely-keyed collection.
 *
 *   * Write the elements out to some data sink.
 *
 * Note that the Cloud Dataflow service may be used to run many different types of jobs, not just
 * Map-Reduce.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Dataflow API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
