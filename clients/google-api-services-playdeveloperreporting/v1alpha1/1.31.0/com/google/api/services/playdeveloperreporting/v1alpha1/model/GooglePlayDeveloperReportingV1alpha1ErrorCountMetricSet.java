/**
 * Singleton resource representing the set of error report metrics. This metric set contains
 * unnormalized error report counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are
 * aggregated in calendar date intervals. The default and only supported timezone is
 * `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `errorReportCount` (`google.type.Decimal`):
 * Absolute count of individual error reports that have been received for an app. * `distinctUsers`
 * (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users for which reports have been received. Care must
 * be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple
 * times. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running
 * on the user's device. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's
 * device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. * `deviceType`
 * (string): identifier of the device's form factor, e.g., PHONE. * `reportType` (string): the type
 * of error. The value should correspond to one of the possible values in ErrorType. * `issueId`
 * (string): the id an error was assigned to. The value should correspond to the `{issue}` component
 * of the issue name. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the
 * _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** *
 * vitals.errors.counts contains normalized metrics about Crashes, another stability metric. *
 * vitals.errors.counts contains normalized metrics about ANRs, another stability metric.
