/**
 * Distribution contains summary statistics for a population of values. It optionally contains a
 * histogram representing the distribution of those values across a set of buckets.The summary
 * statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from the mean, the minimum, and the
 * maximum of the set of population of values. The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and
 * gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given
 * either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths.Although
 * it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values (infinities or NaNs)
 * in the population of values, as this will render the mean and sum_of_squared_deviation fields
 * meaningless.
