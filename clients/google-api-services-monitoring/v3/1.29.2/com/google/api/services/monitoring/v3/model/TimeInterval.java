/**
 * A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both:
 * [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind of the metric value. In no
 * case can the end time be earlier than the start time. For a GAUGE metric, the startTime value is
 * technically optional; if  no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the  end
 * time, and the interval represents a single point in time. Such an  interval is valid only for
 * GAUGE metrics, which are point-in-time  measurements. For DELTA and CUMULATIVE metrics, the start
 * time must be earlier  than the end time. In all cases, the start time of the next interval must
 * be  at least a microsecond after the end time of the previous interval.  Because the interval is
 * closed, if the start time of a new interval  is the same as the end time of the previous
 * interval, data written  at the new start time could overwrite data written at the previous  end
 * time.
 *
