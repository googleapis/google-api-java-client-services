/**
 * This class represents a range of numbers in an address. It is an optional additional field in the
 * 'AddressComponentProto' message. This structure can be used to model both single addresses and
 * address ranges. There are two primary use-cases for address ranges: definitions and references.
 * Ranges are being defined when they are present on the addresses of segment features. Ranges are
 * being referenced when they are present on non-segment features. NOTE: If you add fields in this
 * proto, consider updating the AreAddressRangesEquivalent() function in
 * google3/geostore/base/internal/addressrange.cc
