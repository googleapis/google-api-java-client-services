/**
 * Properties referring a single dimension (either row or column). If both
 * BandedRange.row_properties and BandedRange.column_properties are set, the fill colors are applied
 * to cells according to the following rules:
 *
 * * header_color and footer_color take priority over band colors. * first_band_color takes priority
 * over second_band_color. * row_properties takes priority over column_properties.
 *
 * For example, the first row color takes priority over the first column color, but the first column
 * color takes priority over the second row color. Similarly, the row header takes priority over the
 * column header in the top left cell, but the column header takes priority over the first row color
 * if the row header is not set.
