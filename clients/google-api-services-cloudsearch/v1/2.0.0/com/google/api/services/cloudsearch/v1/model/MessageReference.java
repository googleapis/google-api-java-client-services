/**
 * Contains reference to another message. It is used in shortcuts which are used to collect messages
 * from different spaces with a certain common property into another space. For example, all
 * @mentions of a user are collected into a mention shortcut space (go/chat-shortcuts-backend-design
 * for more details). Clients can use this reference to enable navigation to the source message when
 * the shortcut message is clicked and also to identify a few other details about the source
 * message. Other fields (like text) from the source message are copied on to the top-level fields
 * in the Message proto by the server (More details in go/chat-shortcuts-client-server-design).
