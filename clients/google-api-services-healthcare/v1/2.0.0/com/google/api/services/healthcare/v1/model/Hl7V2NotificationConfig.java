   * Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are
   * matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text
   * inside quotation marks, for example `"query text"`. The only valid relational operation for
   * text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the
   * field be equal to the text. For example, `"Comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in
   * the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an
   * exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`),
   * along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no
   * inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. *
   * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the
   * RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid
   * relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less
   * than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`)
   * operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field
   * query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the
   * expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as
   * special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the
   * `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The following fields and functions are available
   * for filtering: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type =
   * "ADT"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's
   * time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date < "2017-01-02"`. * `send_time`, the
   * timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the
   * MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `create_time`, the
   * timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for
   * comparisons. For example, `create_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `send_facility`, the
   * care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility =
   * "ABC"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID
   * of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example,
   * `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set
   * using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels."priority"="high"`. The operator `:*` can be
   * used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels."priority":*`.
   * The value may be {@code null}.
