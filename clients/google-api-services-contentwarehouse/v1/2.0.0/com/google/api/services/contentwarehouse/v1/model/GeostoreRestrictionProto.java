/**
 * A restriction is an expression that limits when an action can be taken. Each restriction has a
 * set of conditions. If all of the conditions are true, then the restriction applies and the action
 * cannot be taken. For example, the restriction "no turns 3-5pm except buses" would have two
 * conditions: "time is 3-5pm" and "vehicle is not a bus". If both of these conditions apply, the
 * restriction is true, and the turn is prohibited. Multiple restrictions may apply to the same
 * action. Clients handle this by always declaring RestrictionProto as a "repeated" element. The
 * semantics of having multiple restrictions are that if any restriction applies, then the action
 * cannot be taken. In other words, restrictions are OR-ed together. Putting all of this together, a
 * set of RestrictionProtos can be interpreted as a bool expression in disjunctive normal form: (A
 * and B) or (D and E and F) or (G and H) The action is prohibited if this expression is true. Note
 * that a restriction with no conditions is always true, i.e. its action is always prohibited. NOTE:
 * RestrictionProtos are often compared against one another (e.g. to check for duplicate/redundant
 * restrictions) by canonicalizing them via GetCanonicalRestriction() in
 * google3/geostore/base/internal/restriction.cc. Any fields that don't contribute to the definition
 * of a restriction in the real world should be bundled with the annotative fields near the bottom
 * and excluded in GetCanonicalRestriction(). LINT.IfChange
