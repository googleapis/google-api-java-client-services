/**
 * Allows you to manually organize the values in a source data column into buckets with names of
 * your choosing. For example, a pivot table that aggregates population by state:
 *
 *     +-------+-------------------+     | State | SUM of Population |
 * +-------+-------------------+     | AK    |               0.7 |     | AL    |               4.8 |
 * | AR    |               2.9 |     ...     +-------+-------------------+ could be turned into a
 * pivot table that aggregates population by time zone by providing a list of groups (for example,
 * groupName = 'Central', items = ['AL', 'AR', 'IA', ...]) to a manual group rule. Note that a
 * similar effect could be achieved by adding a time zone column to the source data and adjusting
 * the pivot table.
 *
 *     +-----------+-------------------+     | Time Zone | SUM of Population |
 * +-----------+-------------------+     | Central   |             106.3 |     | Eastern   |
 * 151.9 |     | Mountain  |              17.4 |     ...     +-----------+-------------------+
