 * Host project registration refers to the registration of a Google cloud project with Api Hub as a
 * host project. This is the project where Api Hub is provisioned. It acts as the consumer project
 * for the Api Hub instance provisioned. Multiple runtime projects can be attached to the host
 * project and these attachments define the scope of Api Hub.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the API hub API. For a detailed explanation see:
