/**
 * A Triple is a representation of data with a Subject, a Predicate, and an Object, For example:
 * (Triple, IS-A, "data representation"). Triples are a very good representation of data where the
 * relationship between data points is significant, because the Object of a Triple can be the
 * Subject of another Triple: (Triple, HAS-A, Subject) (Subject, IS-A, "Term of a proposition") The
 * ease with which Triples can represent relationships makes them an excellent candidate for
 * representing graphs. Next id: 21
