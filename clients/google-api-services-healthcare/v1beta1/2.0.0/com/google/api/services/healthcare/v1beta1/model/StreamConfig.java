   * The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding

   * existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient",
   * "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts
   * to create one. When a table schema doesn't align with the schema config, either because of
   * existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not
   * stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the
   * server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table
   * recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource
   * mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are
   * written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition.
   * Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and
   * meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version
   * is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since
   * streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the
   * same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery
   * dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId
   * columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist.
   * At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows
   * given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above
   * also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will
   * be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud
   * Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).
