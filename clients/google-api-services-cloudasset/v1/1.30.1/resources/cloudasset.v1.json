However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with\n`allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.\nIn this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and\nnot present in `denied_values`.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a `Constraint`\n`constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of\n`list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.\nSuppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that\nrestricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}.
