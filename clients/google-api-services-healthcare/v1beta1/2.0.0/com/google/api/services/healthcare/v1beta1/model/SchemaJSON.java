 * * `StudyInstanceUID` (Type: STRING): DICOM Tag 0020000D. * `SeriesInstanceUID` (Type: STRING):
 * DICOM Tag 0020000E. * `SOPInstanceUID` (Type: STRING): DICOM Tag 00080018. * `SourceDicomStore`
 * (Type: STRING): The name of the source DICOM store. This field is only included if the
 * `include_source_store` option is set to true. * `Metadata` (Type: JSON): All DICOM tags for the
 * instance, stored in a single JSON object. * `StructuredStorageSize` (Type: INTEGER): Size of the
 * structured storage in bytes. * `DroppedTags` (Type: STRING, Repeated: Yes): List of tags that
 * were dropped during the conversion. * `StorageClass` (Type: STRING): The storage class of the
 * instance. * `LastUpdated` (Type: TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of the last update to the instance. *
 * `BlobStorageSize` (Type: INTEGER): Size of the blob storage in bytes. * `Type` (Type: STRING):
 * Indicates the type of operation (e.g., INSERT, DELETE). This field is *omitted* if
