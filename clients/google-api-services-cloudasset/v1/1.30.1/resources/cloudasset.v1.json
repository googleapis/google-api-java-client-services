However, if `inherit_from_parent` is\nset to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent\nresource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are\nadded to the values inherited up the hierarchy.\n\nSetting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied\nvalues isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration\nsimple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with\n`allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.\nIn this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and\nnot present in `denied_values`.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a `Constraint`\n`constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of\n`list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.\nSuppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that\nrestricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a\n`Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has\n`inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,\nthen an attempt to activate any API will be denied.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for\n`projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`:\n\nExample 1 (no inherited values):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E3\" allowed_values: \"E4\"}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.\n\nExample 2 (inherited values):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {value: \"E3\" value: \"E4\" inherit_from_parent: true}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.\n\nExample 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {denied_values: \"E1\"}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.\n\nExample 4 (RestoreDefault):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {RestoreDefault: {}}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on\nthe value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if\n`DENY`, none).\n\nExample 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):\n  `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.\n  `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.\nThe accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on\nthe value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if\n`DENY`, none).\n\nExample 6 (ListConstraint allowing all):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {all: ALLOW}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.\nAny value is accepted at `projects/bar`.\n\nExample 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {all: DENY}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.\nNo value is accepted at `projects/bar`.\n\nExample 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy):\nGiven the following resource hierarchy\n  O1-\u003e{F1, F2}; F1-\u003e{P1}; F2-\u003e{P2, P3},\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"under:organizations/O1\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {allowed_values: \"under:projects/P3\"}\n    {denied_values: \"under:folders/F2\"}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`,\n  `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`,\n  `projects/P3`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`,\n  `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.",

Requests that specify an invalid value\nare rejected.\n\nAny operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version\n`3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:\n\n* Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding\n* Adding a conditional role binding to a policy\n* Changing a conditional role binding in a policy\n* Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy\n  that includes conditions\n\n**Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field\nwhenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows\nyou to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of\nthe conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.\n\nIf a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may\nspecify any valid version or leave the field unset.\n\nTo learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the\n[IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).",
