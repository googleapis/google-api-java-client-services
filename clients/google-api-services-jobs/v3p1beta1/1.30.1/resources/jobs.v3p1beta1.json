For example, [1, 2, 3] and [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"].\n\nBuilt-in constants:\n\n* MIN (minimum number similar to java Double.MIN_VALUE)\n* MAX (maximum number similar to java Double.MAX_VALUE)\n\nBuilt-in functions:\n\n* bucket(start, end[, label]): bucket built-in function creates a bucket\nwith range of start, end). Note that the end is exclusive. For example,\nbucket(1, MAX, \"positive number\") or bucket(1, 10).\n\nJob histogram facets:\n\n* company_id: histogram by [Job.distributor_company_id.\n* company_display_name: histogram by Job.company_display_name.\n* employment_type: histogram by Job.employment_types. For example,\n\"FULL_TIME\", \"PART_TIME\".\n* company_size: histogram by CompanySize, for example, \"SMALL\",\n\"MEDIUM\", \"BIG\".\n* publish_time_in_month: histogram by the Job.publish_time in months.\nMust specify list of numeric buckets in spec.\n* publish_time_in_year: histogram by the Job.publish_time in years.\nMust specify list of numeric buckets in spec.\n* degree_type: histogram by the Job.degree_type. For example,\n\"Bachelors\", \"Masters\".\n* job_level: histogram by the Job.job_level. For example, \"Entry\nLevel\".\n* country: histogram by the country code of jobs. For example, \"US\", \"FR\".\n* admin1: histogram by the admin1 code of jobs, which is a global\nplaceholder referring to the state, province, or the particular term a\ncountry uses to define the geographic structure below the country level.\nFor example, \"CA\", \"IL\".\n* city: histogram by a combination of the \"city name, admin1 code\". For\nexample,  \"Mountain View, CA\", \"New York, NY\".\n* admin1_country: histogram by a combination of the \"admin1 code, country\".\nFor example, \"CA, US\", \"IL, US\".\n* city_coordinate: histogram by the city center's GPS coordinates (latitude\nand longitude). For example, 37.4038522,-122.0987765. Since the coordinates\nof a city center can change, customers may need to refresh them\nperiodically.\n* locale: histogram by the Job.language_code. For example, \"en-US\",\n\"fr-FR\".\n* language: histogram by the language subtag of the Job.language_code.\nFor example, \"en\", \"fr\".\n* category: histogram by the JobCategory. For example,\n\"COMPUTER_AND_IT\", \"HEALTHCARE\".\n* base_compensation_unit: histogram by the CompensationUnit of base\nsalary. For example, \"WEEKLY\", \"MONTHLY\".\n* base_compensation: histogram by the base salary. Must specify list of\nnumeric buckets to group results by.\n* annualized_base_compensation: histogram by the base annualized salary.\nMust specify list of numeric buckets to group results by.\n* annualized_total_compensation: histogram by the total annualized salary.\nMust specify list of numeric buckets to group results by.\n* string_custom_attribute: histogram by string Job.custom_attributes.\nValues can be accessed via square bracket notations like\nstring_custom_attribute[\"key1\"].\n* numeric_custom_attribute: histogram by numeric Job.custom_attributes.\nValues can be accessed via square bracket notations like\nnumeric_custom_attribute[\"key1\"]. Must specify list of numeric buckets to\ngroup results by.\n\nExample expressions:\n* count(admin1)\n* count(base_compensation, [bucket(1000, 10000), bucket(10000, 100000),\nbucket(100000, MAX)])\n* count(string_custom_attribute[\"some-string-custom-attribute\"])\n* count(numeric_custom_attribute[\"some-numeric-custom-attribute\"],\n[bucket(MIN, 0, \"negative\"), bucket(0, MAX, \"non-negative\"])"
