 * A backup's position in a quantity-based retention queue, of backups with the same source cluster
 * and type, with length, retention, specified by the backup's retention policy. Once the position
 * is greater than the retention, the backup is eligible to be garbage collected. Example: 5 backups
 * from the same source cluster and type with a quantity-based retention of 3 and denoted by
 * backup_id (position, retention). Safe: backup_5 (1, 3), backup_4, (2, 3), backup_3 (3, 3).
 * Awaiting garbage collection: backup_2 (4, 3), backup_1 (5, 3)
