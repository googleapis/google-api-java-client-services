/**
 * An object representing a short code, which is a phone number that is typically much shorter than
 * regular phone numbers and can be used to address messages in MMS and SMS systems, as well as for
 * abbreviated dialing (For example "Text 611 to see how many minutes you have remaining on your
 * plan."). Short codes are restricted to a region and are not internationally dialable, which means
 * the same short code can exist in different regions, with different usage and pricing, even if
 * those regions share the same country calling code (For example: US and CA).
