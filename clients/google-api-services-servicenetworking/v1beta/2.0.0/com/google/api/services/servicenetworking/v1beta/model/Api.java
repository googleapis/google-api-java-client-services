/**
 * Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface. Interfaces are also described as "protocol
 * buffer services" in some contexts, such as by the "service" keyword in a .proto file, but they
 * are different from API Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an interface as
 * opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They are also sometimes simply referred
 * to as "APIs" in other contexts, such as the name of this message itself. See
 * https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary for detailed terminology.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Service Networking API. For a detailed explanation
 * see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
