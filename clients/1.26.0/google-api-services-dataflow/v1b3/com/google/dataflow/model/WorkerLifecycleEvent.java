/**
 * A report of an event in a worker's lifecycle. The proto contains one event, because the worker is
 * expected to asynchronously send each message immediately after the event. Due to this asynchrony,
 * messages may arrive out of order (or missing), and it is up to the consumer to interpret. The
 * timestamp of the event is in the enclosing WorkerMessage proto.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Dataflow API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
