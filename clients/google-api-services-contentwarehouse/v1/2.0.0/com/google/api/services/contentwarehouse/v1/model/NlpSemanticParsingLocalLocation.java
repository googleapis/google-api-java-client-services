/**
 * There are a few types of locations: - Basic locations are sequences of location elements which
 * can be either actual locations or modifiers. E.g., "Mountain View CA 94040" may be the sequence
 * "Mountain View" (an actual location), "CA" (an actual location, and "94040" (a numeric modifier).
 * - Compound locations: these are two locations combined by a joiner. E.g., "Target in Mountain
 * View CA 94040" has the joiner "in" and two basic locations ("Target", and "Mountain View CA
 * 94040"). Note that the definition is recursive, e.g., "Parking garage near Target in Mountain
 * View". - Vicinity location: indicates an area around a certain location. The area can be defined
 * by time or space. E.g., "within 1 hour of Palo Alto", "10 blocks from Union Square", "a few miles
 * from here". Next ID: 14 LINT.IfChange()
