/**
 * A restriction group represents common properties of a set of restrictions on segments that are
 * associated with the same underlying cause across a geographic region. Every segment referenced by
 * this restriction group should have at least one restriction that refers backs to this restriction
 * group. The standard feature properties have the following interpretations: name - A name that
 * represents the name for this restriction group. kg_property - A reference back to a KG event in
 * case this restriction group belongs to an event in KG.
 * /geo/type/restriction_group/associated_event contains a mid to the associated event.
