 * A resource containing sign in details for an enterprise. Use enterprises to manage SigninDetails
 * for a given enterprise.For an enterprise, we can have any number of SigninDetails that is
 * uniquely identified by combination of the following three fields (signin_url,
 * allow_personal_usage, token_tag). One cannot create two SigninDetails with the same (signin_url,
 * allow_personal_usage, token_tag). (token_tag is an optional field).Patch: The operation updates
 * the current list of SigninDetails with the new list of SigninDetails. If the stored SigninDetail
 * configuration is passed, it returns the same signin_enrollment_token and qr_code. If we pass
 * multiple identical SigninDetail configurations that are not stored, it will store the first one
 * amongst those SigninDetail configurations. if the configuration already exists we cannot request
 * it more than once in a particular patch API call, otherwise it will give a duplicate key error
 * and the whole operation will fail. If we remove certain SigninDetail configuration from the
 * request then it will get removed from the storage. We can then request another
 * signin_enrollment_token and qr_code for the same SigninDetail configuration.
