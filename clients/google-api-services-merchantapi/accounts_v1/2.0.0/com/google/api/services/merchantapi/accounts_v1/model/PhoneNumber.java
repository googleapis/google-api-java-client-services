/**
 * An object representing a phone number, suitable as an API wire format. This representation: -
 * should not be used for locale-specific formatting of a phone number, such as "+1 (650) 253-0000
 * ext. 123" - is not designed for efficient storage - may not be suitable for dialing - specialized
 * libraries (see references) should be used to parse the number for that purpose To do something
 * meaningful with this number, such as format it for various use-cases, convert it to an
 * `i18n.phonenumbers.PhoneNumber` object first. For instance, in Java this would be:
 * com.google.type.PhoneNumber wireProto = com.google.type.PhoneNumber.newBuilder().build();
 * com.google.i18n.phonenumbers.Phonenumber.PhoneNumber phoneNumber =
 * PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance().parse(wireProto.getE164Number(), "ZZ"); if
 * (!wireProto.getExtension().isEmpty()) { phoneNumber.setExtension(wireProto.getExtension()); }
