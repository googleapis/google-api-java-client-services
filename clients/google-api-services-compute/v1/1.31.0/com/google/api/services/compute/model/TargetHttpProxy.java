/**
 * Represents a Target HTTP Proxy resource.
 *
 * Google Compute Engine has two Target HTTP Proxy resources:
 *
 * * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/targetHttpProxies) *
 * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionTargetHttpProxies)
 *
 * A target HTTP proxy is a component of GCP HTTP load balancers.
 *
 * * targetHttpProxies are used by external HTTP load balancers and Traffic Director. *
 * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by internal HTTP load balancers.
 *
 * Forwarding rules reference a target HTTP proxy, and the target proxy then references a URL map.
 * For more information, read Using Target Proxies and  Forwarding rule concepts. (== resource_for
 * {$api_version}.targetHttpProxies ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.regionTargetHttpProxies ==)
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Compute Engine API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
