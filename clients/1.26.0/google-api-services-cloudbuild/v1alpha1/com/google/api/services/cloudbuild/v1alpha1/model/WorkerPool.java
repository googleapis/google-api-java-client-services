 * Configuration for a WorkerPool to run the builds.
 *
 * Workers are machines that Cloud Build uses to run your builds. By default, all workers run in a
 * project owned by Cloud Build. To have full control over the workers that execute your builds --
 * such as enabling them to access private resources on your private network -- you can request
 * Cloud Build to run the workers in your own project by creating a custom workers pool.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Build API. For a detailed explanation see:
