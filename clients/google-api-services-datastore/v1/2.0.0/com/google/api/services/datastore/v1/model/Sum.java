/**
 * Sum of the values of the requested property. * Only numeric values will be aggregated. All non-
 * numeric values including `NULL` are skipped. * If the aggregated values contain `NaN`, returns
 * `NaN`. Infinity math follows IEEE-754 standards. * If the aggregated value set is empty, returns
 * 0. * Returns a 64-bit integer if all aggregated numbers are integers and the sum result does not
 * overflow. Otherwise, the result is returned as a double. Note that even if all the aggregated
 * values are integers, the result is returned as a double if it cannot fit within a 64-bit signed
 * integer. When this occurs, the returned value will lose precision. * When underflow occurs,
 * floating-point aggregation is non-deterministic. This means that running the same query
 * repeatedly without any changes to the underlying values could produce slightly different results
 * each time. In those cases, values should be stored as integers over floating-point numbers.
