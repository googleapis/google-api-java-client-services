/**
 * Restrictions that affect the delivery of the stanza. By default, Stanzas are publishable, which
 * means that they are eligible for indexing, aggregation, and other delivery options (Goops,
 * Moonshine, notifications). A stanza can be created in a "do not publish" state; the stanza will
 * not be published anywhere. The restriction can subsequently be removed with an UpdateStanza call,
 * at which point the post will be treated as if it were newly created. A few notes/limitations
 * about this option: 1. Client should keep a stanza unpublishable for a small period of time (if
 * possible to) so that our ranking system does not consider this as a stale post (thus downranking
 * the post). 2. Client should keep the number of unpublishable stanzas to a minimum, to reduce
 * under-serving. 3. Updating a stanza from publishable to unpublishable after creation is not
 * supported 4. At this time, publishing options are only supported on root stanzas; let us know if
 * you require this for child stanzas. 5. Similarly, this is only supported as a global restriction.
 * It may not be set as a per-destination-stream restriction.
