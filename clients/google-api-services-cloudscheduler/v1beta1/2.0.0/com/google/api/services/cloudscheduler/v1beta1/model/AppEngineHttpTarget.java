 * App Engine target. The job will be pushed to a job handler by means of an HTTP request via an
 * http_method such as HTTP POST, HTTP GET, etc. The job is acknowledged by means of an HTTP
 * response code in the range [200 - 299]. Error 503 is considered an App Engine system error
 * instead of an application error. Requests returning error 503 will be retried regardless of retry
 * configuration and not counted against retry counts. Any other response code, or a failure to
 * receive a response before the deadline, constitutes a failed attempt.
