/**
 * An optional Metadata to attach to any RPC request to tell the server about an external context of
 * the request. The server may use this for logging or other purposes. To use it, the client
 * attaches the header to the call using the canonical proto serialization: * name:
 * `build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.requestmetadata-bin` * contents: the base64 encoded binary
 * `RequestMetadata` message. Note: the gRPC library serializes binary headers encoded in base 64 by
 * default (https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests). Therefore, if
 * the gRPC library is used to pass/retrieve this metadata, the user may ignore the base64 encoding
 * and assume it is simply serialized as a binary message.
