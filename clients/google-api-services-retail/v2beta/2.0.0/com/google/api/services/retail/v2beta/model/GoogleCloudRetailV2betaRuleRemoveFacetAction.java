 * Removes an attribute/facet in the request if is present. * Rule Condition: Must specify non-empty
 * Condition.query_terms (for search only) or Condition.page_categories (for browse only), but can't
 * specify both. * Action Input: attribute name * Action Result: Will remove the attribute (as a
 * facet) from the request if it is present. Example: Suppose the query is "shoes", the
 * Condition.query_terms is "shoes" and the attribute name "size", then facet key "size" will be
 * removed from the request (if it is present).
