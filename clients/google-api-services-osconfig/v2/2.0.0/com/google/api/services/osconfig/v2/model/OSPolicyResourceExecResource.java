/**
 * A resource that allows executing scripts on the VM. The `ExecResource` has 2 stages: `validate`
 * and `enforce` and both stages accept a script as an argument to execute. When the `ExecResource`
 * is applied by the agent, it first executes the script in the `validate` stage. The `validate`
 * stage can signal that the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit
 * code of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should return an exit code
 * of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error. If the
 * `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code from the `validate` stage, the
 * agent proceeds to execute the script from the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already
 * in the desired state, the `enforce` stage will not be run. Similar to `validate` stage, the
 * `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its
 * desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen
 * over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired
 * state` and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit code of `0` unless
 * an `exit` statement is provided in the script. So, for reasons of consistency and being explicit,
 * exit codes `100` and `101` were chosen.
 *
