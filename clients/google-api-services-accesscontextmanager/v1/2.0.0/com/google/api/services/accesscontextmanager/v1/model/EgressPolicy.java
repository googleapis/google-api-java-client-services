/**
 * Policy for egress from perimeter. EgressPolicies match requests based on `egress_from` and
 * `egress_to` stanzas. For an EgressPolicy to match, both `egress_from` and `egress_to` stanzas
 * must be matched. If an EgressPolicy matches a request, the request is allowed to span the
 * ServicePerimeter boundary. For example, an EgressPolicy can be used to allow VMs on networks
 * within the ServicePerimeter to access a defined set of projects outside the perimeter in certain
 * contexts (e.g. to read data from a Cloud Storage bucket or query against a BigQuery dataset).
 * EgressPolicies are concerned with the *resources* that a request relates as well as the API
 * services and API actions being used. They do not related to the direction of data movement. More
 * detailed documentation for this concept can be found in the descriptions of EgressFrom and
 * EgressTo.
