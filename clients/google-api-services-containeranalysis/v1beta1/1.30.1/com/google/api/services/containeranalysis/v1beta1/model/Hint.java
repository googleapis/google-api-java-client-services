/**
 * This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the authority. Because the
 * name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name
 * of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from "readable" names more suitable for
 * debug output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in security
 * sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to verify.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Container Analysis API. For a detailed explanation
