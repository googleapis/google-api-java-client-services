/**
 * Updates all cells in the range to the values in the given Cell object. Only the fields listed in
 * the fields field are updated; others are unchanged.
 *
 * If writing a cell with a formula, the formula's ranges will automatically increment for each
 * field in the range. For example, if writing a cell with formula `=A1` into range B2:C4, B2 would
 * be `=A1`, B3 would be `=A2`, B4 would be `=A3`, C2 would be `=B1`, C3 would be `=B2`, C4 would be
 * `=B3`.
 *
 * To keep the formula's ranges static, use the `$` indicator. For example, use the formula `=$A$1`
 * to prevent both the row and the column from incrementing.
