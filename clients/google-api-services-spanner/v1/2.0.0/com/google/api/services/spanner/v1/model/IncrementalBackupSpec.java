/**
 * The specification for incremental backup chains. An incremental backup stores the delta of
 * changes between a previous backup and the database contents at a given version time. An
 * incremental backup chain consists of a full backup and zero or more successive incremental
 * backups. The first backup created for an incremental backup chain is always a full backup.
