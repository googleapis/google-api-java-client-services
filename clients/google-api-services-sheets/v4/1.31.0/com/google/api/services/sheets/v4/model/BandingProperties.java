/**
 * Properties referring a single dimension (either row or column). If both
 * BandedRange.row_properties and BandedRange.column_properties are set, the fill colors are applied
 * to cells according to the following rules: * header_color and footer_color take priority over
 * band colors. * first_band_color takes priority over second_band_color. * row_properties takes
 * priority over column_properties. For example, the first row color takes priority over the first
 * column color, but the first column color takes priority over the second row color. Similarly, the
 * row header takes priority over the column header in the top left cell, but the column header
 * takes priority over the first row color if the row header is not set.
