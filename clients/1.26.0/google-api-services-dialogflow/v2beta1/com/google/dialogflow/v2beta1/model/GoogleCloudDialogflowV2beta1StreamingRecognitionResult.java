/**
 * Contains a speech recognition result corresponding to a portion of the audio that is currently
 * being processed or an indication that this is the end of the single requested utterance.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * 1.  transcript: "tube"
 *
 * 2.  transcript: "to be a"
 *
 * 3.  transcript: "to be"
 *
 * 4.  transcript: "to be or not to be"     is_final: true
 *
 * 5.  transcript: " that's"
 *
 * 6.  transcript: " that is"
 *
 * 7.  recognition_event_type: `RECOGNITION_EVENT_END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE`
 *
 * 8.  transcript: " that is the question"     is_final: true
 *
 * Only two of the responses contain final results (#4 and #8 indicated by `is_final: true`).
 * Concatenating these generates the full transcript: "to be or not to be that is the question".
 *
 * In each response we populate:
 *
 * *  for `MESSAGE_TYPE_TRANSCRIPT`: `transcript` and possibly `is_final`.
 *
 * *  for `MESSAGE_TYPE_END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE`: only `event_type`.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Dialogflow API. For a detailed explanation see:
