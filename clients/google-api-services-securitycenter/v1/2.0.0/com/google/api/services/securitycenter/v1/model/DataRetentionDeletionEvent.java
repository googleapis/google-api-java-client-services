 * Retention Deletion (DRD) control is a control of the DSPM (Data Security Posture Management)
 * suite that enables organizations to manage data retention and deletion policies in compliance
 * with regulations, such as GDPR and CRPA. DRD supports two primary policy types: maximum storage
 * length (max TTL) and minimum storage length (min TTL). Both are aimed at helping organizations
 * meet regulatory and data management commitments.
