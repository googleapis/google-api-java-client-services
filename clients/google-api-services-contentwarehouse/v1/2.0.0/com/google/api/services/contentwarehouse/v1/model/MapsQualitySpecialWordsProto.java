/**
 * The goal of the special words are to: - Canonicalize the user query by rewriting abbreviations
 * into the canonical version that is indexed. - Figure out at index time for each element which
 * tokens are important. We use this to decide if an address component is matched or not. For
 * instance in "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW" since "NW" is recognised as a directional (and "Ave" is
 * recognised as a street visible type), "Pennsylvania" becomes the name and you can't match this
 * street by just specifying "avenue" or "NW".
