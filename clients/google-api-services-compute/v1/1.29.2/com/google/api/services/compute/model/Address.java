/**
 * Represents an IP Address resource.
 *
 * An address resource represents a regional internal IP address. Regional internal IP addresses are
 * RFC 1918 addresses that come from either a primary or secondary IP range of a subnet in a VPC
 * network. Regional external IP addresses can be assigned to GCP VM instances, Cloud VPN gateways,
 * regional external forwarding rules for network load balancers (in either Standard or Premium
 * Tier), and regional external forwarding rules for HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP Proxy load
 * balancers in Standard Tier. For more information, read IP addresses.
 *
 * A globalAddresses resource represent a global external IP address. Global external IP addresses
 * are IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. They can only be assigned to global forwarding rules for HTTP(S), SSL
 * Proxy, or TCP Proxy load balancers in Premium Tier. For more information, read Global resources.
