/**
 * Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and Configurations which
 * implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access
 * controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout
 * policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the underlying Routes
 * and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment orchestrates ReplicaSets). The Service's
 * controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration and Route, reflecting their
 * statuses and conditions as its own.
 *
