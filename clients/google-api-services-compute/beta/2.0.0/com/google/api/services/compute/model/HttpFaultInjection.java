/**
 * The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients
 * to backend service failure. As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend
 * service, delays can be introduced by the load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending
 * those request to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load
 * balancer for a percentage of requests.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
