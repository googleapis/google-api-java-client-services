/**
 * A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and
 * fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts
 * like "day" or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp
 * values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately
 * +-10,000 years.
