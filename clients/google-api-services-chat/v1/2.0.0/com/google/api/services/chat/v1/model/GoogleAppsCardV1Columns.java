/**
 * The `Columns` widget displays up to 2 columns in a card or dialog. You can add widgets to each
 * column; the widgets appear in the order that they are specified. For an example in Google Chat
 * apps, see [Columns](https://developers.google.com/chat/ui/widgets/columns). The height of each
 * column is determined by the taller column. For example, if the first column is taller than the
 * second column, both columns have the height of the first column. Because each column can contain
 * a different number of widgets, you can't define rows or align widgets between the columns.
 * Columns are displayed side-by-side. You can customize the width of each column using the
 * `HorizontalSizeStyle` field. If the user's screen width is too narrow, the second column wraps
 * below the first: * On web, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to
 * 480 pixels. * On iOS devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal
 * to 300 pt. * On Android devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or
 * equal to 320 dp. To include more than 2 columns, or to use rows, use the `Grid` widget. [Google
 * Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend): Columns for
 * Google Workspace Add-ons are in Developer Preview.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
