   * and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts
   * shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued
   * in a short period of time.
   *
   * The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the
   * rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum
   * specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the
   * bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will
   * be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second.
   *
   * Cloud Tasks will pick the value of `max_burst_size` based on the value of
   * max_dispatches_per_second.
   *
   * For queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [b
   * ucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size
   * ). Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if UpdateQueue is called on a queue created by
   * `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based on the value of
