/**
 * A system freeze period. When a device’s clock is within the freeze period, all incoming system
 * updates (including security patches) are blocked and won’t be installed.When the device is
 * outside any set freeze periods, the normal policy behavior (automatic, windowed, or postponed)
 * applies.Leap years are ignored in freeze period calculations, in particular: If Feb. 29th is set
 * as the start or end date of a freeze period, the freeze period will start or end on Feb. 28th
 * instead. When a device’s system clock reads Feb. 29th, it’s treated as Feb. 28th. When
 * calculating the number of days in a freeze period or the time between two freeze periods, Feb.
 * 29th is ignored and not counted as a day.Note: For Freeze Periods to take effect,
 * SystemUpdateType cannot be specified as SYSTEM_UPDATE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, because freeze periods
 * require a defined policy to be specified.
