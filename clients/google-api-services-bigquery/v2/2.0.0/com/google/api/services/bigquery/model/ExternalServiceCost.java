 * The external service cost is a portion of the total cost, these costs are not additive with
 * total_bytes_billed. Moreover, this field only track external service costs that will show up as
 * BigQuery costs (e.g. training BigQuery ML job with google cloud CAIP or Automl Tables services),
 * not other costs which may be accrued by running the query (e.g. reading from Bigtable or Cloud
 * Storage). The external service costs with different billing sku (e.g. CAIP job is charged based
 * on VM usage) are converted to BigQuery billed_bytes and slot_ms with equivalent amount of US
 * dollars. Services may not directly correlate to these metrics, but these are the equivalents for
 * billing purposes. Output only.
