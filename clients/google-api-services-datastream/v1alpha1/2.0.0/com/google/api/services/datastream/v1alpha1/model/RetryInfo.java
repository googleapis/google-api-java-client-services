/**
 * Describes when the clients can retry a failed request. Clients could ignore the recommendation
 * here or retry when this information is missing from error responses. It's always recommended that
 * clients should use exponential backoff when retrying. Clients should wait until `retry_delay`
 * amount of time has passed since receiving the error response before retrying. If retrying
 * requests also fail, clients should use an exponential backoff scheme to gradually increase the
 * delay between retries based on `retry_delay`, until either a maximum number of retries have been
 * reached or a maximum retry delay cap has been reached.
 *
