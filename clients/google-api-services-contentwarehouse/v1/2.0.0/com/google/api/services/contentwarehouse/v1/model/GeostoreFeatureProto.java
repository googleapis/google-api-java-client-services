   * http://go/geo-addresses Note the following conventions: - Addresses follow the postal
   * hierarchy, not the political hierarchy. Addresses may have components that refer to political
   * entities when those entities also appear in the postal hierarchy. - As stated previously, but
   * it bears repeating, addresses on features are mailing addresses. In many cases the physical
   * address and the mailing address are the same but the address stored on a feature represents the
   * mailing address of the feature. An example of a non-physical mailing address would be a PO Box.
   * - These addresses are commonly defined and verifiable by a governmental authority (e.g. the
