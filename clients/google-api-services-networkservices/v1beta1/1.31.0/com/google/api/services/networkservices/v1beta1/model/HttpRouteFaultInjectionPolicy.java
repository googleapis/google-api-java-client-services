/**
 * The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients
 * to destination service failure. As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a
 * destination, delays can be introduced by client proxy on a percentage of requests before sending
 * those requests to the destination service. Similarly requests can be aborted by client proxy for
 * a percentage of requests.
