/**
 * A route is a collection of segments that forms a logical group - usually a named road or highway.
 * Segments can belong to more than one route, and the segments of one route may be a subset of the
 * segments of another route (e.g. I-5 N is a subset of I-5). Segments in the collection that define
 * the route do not need to constitute a single uninterrupted line, there can be disconnects. The
 * standard feature properties are interpreted as follows: name - Routes should have one or more
 * names. (While unnamed roads certainly exist in the real world, we choose not to create route
 * features for such roads. Instead, the unnamed segments are merely not part of any route.) address
 * - This should always be empty. type - Specifies a particular route subtype, see feature.proto.
 * point - This should always be empty. polyline - This should always be empty. polygon - This
 * should always be empty. child - The pairs of segments that belong to this route (a given route
 * should always reference segments in both travel directions).
 *
