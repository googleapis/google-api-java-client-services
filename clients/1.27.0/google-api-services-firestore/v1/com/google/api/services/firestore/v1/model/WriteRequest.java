 * The request for Firestore.Write.

 * The first request creates a stream, or resumes an existing one from a token.
 *
 * When creating a new stream, the server replies with a response containing only an ID and a token,
 * to use in the next request.
 *
 * When resuming a stream, the server first streams any responses later than the given token, then a
 * response containing only an up-to-date token, to use in the next request.
