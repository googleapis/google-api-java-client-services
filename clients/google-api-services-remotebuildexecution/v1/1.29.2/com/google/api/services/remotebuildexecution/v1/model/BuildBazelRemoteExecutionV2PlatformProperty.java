/**
 * A single property for the environment. The server is responsible for specifying the property
 * `name`s that it accepts. If an unknown `name` is provided in the requirements for an Action, the
 * server SHOULD reject the execution request. If permitted by the server, the same `name` may occur
 * multiple times.
 *
 * The server is also responsible for specifying the interpretation of property `value`s. For
 * instance, a property describing how much RAM must be available may be interpreted as allowing a
 * worker with 16GB to fulfill a request for 8GB, while a property describing the OS environment on
 * which the action must be performed may require an exact match with the worker's OS.
 *
 * The server MAY use the `value` of one or more properties to determine how it sets up the
 * execution environment, such as by making specific system files available to the worker.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Remote Build Execution API. For a detailed
 * explanation see:
