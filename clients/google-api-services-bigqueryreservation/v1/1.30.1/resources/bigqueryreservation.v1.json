Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation.
