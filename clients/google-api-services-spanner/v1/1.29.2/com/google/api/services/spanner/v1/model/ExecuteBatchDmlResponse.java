/**
 * The response for ExecuteBatchDml. Contains a list of ResultSet, one for each DML statement that
 * has successfully executed. If a statement fails, the error is returned as part of the response
 * payload. Clients can determine whether all DML statements have run successfully, or if a
 * statement failed, using one of the following approaches:
 *
 *   1. Check if `'status'` field is `OkStatus`.   2. Check if `result_sets_size()` equals the
 * number of statements in      ExecuteBatchDmlRequest.
 *
 * Example 1: A request with 5 DML statements, all executed successfully.
 *
 * Result: A response with 5 ResultSets, one for each statement in the same order, and an
 * `OkStatus`.
 *
 * Example 2: A request with 5 DML statements. The 3rd statement has a syntax error.
 *
 * Result: A response with 2 ResultSets, for the first 2 statements that run successfully, and a
 * syntax error (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`) status. From `result_set_size()` client can determine that the
 * 3rd statement has failed.
 *
