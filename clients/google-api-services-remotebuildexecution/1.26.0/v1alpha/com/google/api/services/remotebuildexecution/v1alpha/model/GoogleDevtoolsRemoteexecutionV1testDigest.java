/**
 * A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob and its hash. The
 * hash algorithm to use is defined by the server, but servers SHOULD use SHA-256.
 *
 * The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is,
 * even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject
 * the request.
 *
 * The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server
 * needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with
 * it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the
 * server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more
 * complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing
 * the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that
 * the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server
 * implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.
 *
 * When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary
 * encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize
 * messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the
 * same message. - Fields are serialized in tag order. - There are no unknown fields. - There are no
 * duplicate fields. - Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.
 *
 * Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care
 * should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may
 * produce duplicate fields.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Remote Build Execution API. For a detailed
 * explanation see:
