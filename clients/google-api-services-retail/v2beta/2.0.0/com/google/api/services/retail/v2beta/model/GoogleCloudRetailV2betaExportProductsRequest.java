   * A filtering expression to specify restrictions on returned events. The expression is a sequence
   * of terms. Each term applies a restriction to the returned products. Use this expression to
   * restrict results to a specific time range, tag, or stock state or to filter products by product
   * type. For example, `lastModifiedTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
   * lastModifiedTime<"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" productType=primary` We expect only four types of
   * fields: * `lastModifiedTime`: This can be specified twice, once with a less than operator and
   * once with a greater than operator. The `lastModifiedTime` restriction should result in one,
   * contiguous, valid, last-modified, time range. * `productType`: Supported values are `primary`
   * and `variant`. The Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed
   * in parentheses and must be separated from the `productType` values by a space. *
   * `availability`: Supported values are `IN_STOCK`, `OUT_OF_STOCK`, `PREORDER`, and `BACKORDER`.
   * Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses and
   * must be separated from the `availability` values by a space. * `Tag expressions`: Restricts
   * output to products that match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are
   * supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses and the operators are separated from the
   * tag values by a space. Also supported is '`-"tagA"`', which is equivalent to '`NOT "tagA"`'.
   * Tag values must be double-quoted, UTF-8 encoded strings and have a size limit of 1,000
   * characters. Some examples of valid filters expressions: * Example 1: `lastModifiedTime >
   * "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" lastModifiedTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"` * Example 2:
   * `lastModifiedTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" productType = "variant"` * Example 3:
   * `tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT "promotional") productType = "primary"
   * lastModifiedTime < "2018-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"` * Example 4: `lastModifiedTime >
   * "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"` * Example 5: `availability = (IN_STOCK OR BACKORDER)`
   * The value may be {@code null}.
