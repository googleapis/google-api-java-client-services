 * A Google Chat app interaction event that represents and contains data about a user's interaction
 * with a Chat app. To configure your Chat app to receive interaction events, see [Receive and
 * respond to user interactions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/receive-respond-
 * interactions). In addition to receiving events from user interactions, Chat apps can receive
 * events about changes to spaces, such as when a new member is added to a space. To learn about
 * space events, see [Work with events from Google
 * Chat](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/events-overview). Note: This event is only
 * used for [Chat interaction events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/receive-respond-
 * interactions). If your Chat app is built as a [Google Workspace add-
 * on](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/chat/build), see [Chat event
 * objects](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/concepts/event-objects#chat-event-
 * object) in the add-ons documentation.
