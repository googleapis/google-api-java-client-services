/**
 * App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app
 * when the task is dispatched. Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires
 * [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
 * Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth
 * /cloud-platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same
 * project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are
 * Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how
 * routing is affected by [dispatch
 * files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted
 * during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a
 * communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example,
 * HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol.
 * The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the
 * queue-level or task-level: * If app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is
 * used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level
 * app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_uri
 * Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with
 * [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because
 * tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login:
 * required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches
 * also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns
 * an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's
 * handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the
 * deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service
 * Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and will
 * cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches.
 * Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does
 * not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Tasks API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
