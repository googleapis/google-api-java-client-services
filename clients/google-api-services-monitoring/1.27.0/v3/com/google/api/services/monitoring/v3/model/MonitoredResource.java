/**
 * An object representing a resource that can be used for monitoring, logging, billing, or other
 * purposes. Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as
 * disks. The type field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the
 * resource's schema. Information in the labels field identifies the actual resource and its
 * attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be
 * represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for "gce_instance"
 * has labels "instance_id" and "zone": { "type": "gce_instance",   "labels": { "instance_id":
 * "12345678901234",               "zone": "us-central1-a" }}
