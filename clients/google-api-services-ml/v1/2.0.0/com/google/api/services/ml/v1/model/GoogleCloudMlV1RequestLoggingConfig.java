/**
 * Configuration for logging request-response pairs to a BigQuery table. Online prediction requests
 * to a model version and the responses to these requests are converted to raw strings and saved to
 * the specified BigQuery table. Logging is constrained by [BigQuery quotas and
 * limits](/bigquery/quotas). If your project exceeds BigQuery quotas or limits, AI Platform
 * Prediction does not log request-response pairs, but it continues to serve predictions. If you are
 * using [continuous evaluation](/ml-engine/docs/continuous-evaluation/), you do not need to specify
 * this configuration manually. Setting up continuous evaluation automatically enables logging of
 * request-response pairs.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the AI Platform Training & Prediction API. For a detailed
 * explanation see:
