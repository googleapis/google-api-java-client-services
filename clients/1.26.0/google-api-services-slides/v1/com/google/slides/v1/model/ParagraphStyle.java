/**
 * Styles that apply to a whole paragraph.
 *
 * If this text is contained in a shape with a parent placeholder, then these paragraph styles may
 * be inherited from the parent. Which paragraph styles are inherited depend on the nesting level of
 * lists:
 *
 * * A paragraph not in a list will inherit its paragraph style from the   paragraph at the 0
 * nesting level of the list inside the parent placeholder. * A paragraph in a list will inherit its
 * paragraph style from the paragraph   at its corresponding nesting level of the list inside the
 * parent   placeholder.
 *
 * Inherited paragraph styles are represented as unset fields in this message.
