 * passthrough Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/network
 * /networklb-failover-overview). On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection
 * draining will be honored. Google Cloud has a fixed connection draining timeout of 10 minutes. A
 * setting of true terminates existing TCP connections to the active pool during failover and
 * failback, immediately draining traffic. A setting of false allows existing TCP connections to
 * persist, even on VMs no longer in the active pool, for up to the duration of the connection
 * draining timeout (10 minutes).
