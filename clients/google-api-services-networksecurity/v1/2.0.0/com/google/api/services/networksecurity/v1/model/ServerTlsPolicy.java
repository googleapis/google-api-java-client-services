/**
 * ServerTlsPolicy is a resource that specifies how a server should authenticate incoming requests.
 * This resource itself does not affect configuration unless it is attached to a target HTTPS proxy
 * or endpoint config selector resource. ServerTlsPolicy in the form accepted by External HTTPS Load
 * Balancer can be attached only to TargetHttpsProxy with an `EXTERNAL` or `EXTERNAL_MANAGED` load
 * balancing scheme. Traffic Director compatible ServerTlsPolicies can be attached to EndpointPolicy
 * and TargetHttpsProxy with Traffic Director `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` load balancing scheme.
