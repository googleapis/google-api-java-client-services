/**
 * Checkbox input allows merchants to provide a boolean value. Corresponds to the [html input
 * type=checkbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html-
 * markup-20121025/input.checkbox.html#input.checkbox). If merchant checks the box, the input value
 * for the field is `true`, otherwise it is `false`. This type of input is often used as a
 * confirmation that the merchant completed required steps before they are allowed to start the
 * action. In such a case, the input field is marked as required and the button to trigger the
 * action should stay disabled until the merchant checks the box.
