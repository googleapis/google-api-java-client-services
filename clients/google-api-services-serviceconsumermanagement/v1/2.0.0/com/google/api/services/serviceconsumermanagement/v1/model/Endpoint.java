/**
 * `Endpoint` describes a network address of a service that serves a set of APIs. It is commonly
 * known as a service endpoint. A service may expose any number of service endpoints, and all
 * service endpoints share the same service definition, such as quota limits and monitoring metrics.
 * Example: type: google.api.Service name: library-example.googleapis.com endpoints: # Declares
 * network address `https://library-example.googleapis.com` # for service `library-
 * example.googleapis.com`. The `https` scheme # is implicit for all service endpoints. Other
 * schemes may be # supported in the future. - name: library-example.googleapis.com allow_cors:
 * false - name: content-staging-library-example.googleapis.com # Allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be
 * passed to the API frontend, for it # to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
 * allowed # to proceed. allow_cors: true
 *
