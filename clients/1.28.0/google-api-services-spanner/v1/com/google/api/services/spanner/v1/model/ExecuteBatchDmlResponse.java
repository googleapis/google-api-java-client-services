/**
 * The response for ExecuteBatchDml. Contains a list of ResultSet, one for each DML statement that
 * has successfully executed. If a statement fails, the error is returned as part of the response
 * payload. Clients can determine whether all DML statements have run successfully, or if a
 * statement failed, using one of the following approaches:
 *
 *   1. Check if 'status' field is OkStatus.   2. Check if result_sets_size() equals the number of
 * statements in      ExecuteBatchDmlRequest.
 *
 * Example 1: A request with 5 DML statements, all executed successfully. Result: A response with 5
 * ResultSets, one for each statement in the same order, and an OK status.
 *
 * Example 2: A request with 5 DML statements. The 3rd statement has a syntax error. Result: A
 * response with 2 ResultSets, for the first 2 statements that run successfully, and a syntax error
 * (INVALID_ARGUMENT) status. From result_set_size() client can determine that the 3rd statement has
 * failed.
 *
