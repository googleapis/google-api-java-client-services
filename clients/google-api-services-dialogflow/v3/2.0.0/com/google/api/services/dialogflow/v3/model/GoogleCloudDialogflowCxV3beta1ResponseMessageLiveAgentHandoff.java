 * Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent. Dialogflow only uses this

 * example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went
 * extremely wrong in the conversation. * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer
 * issue can only be handled by a human.
