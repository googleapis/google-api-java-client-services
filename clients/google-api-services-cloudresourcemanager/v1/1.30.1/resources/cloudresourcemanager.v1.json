However, if `inherit_from_parent` is\nset to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent\nresource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are\nadded to the values inherited up the hierarchy.\n\nSetting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied\nvalues isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration\nsimple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with\n`allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.\nIn this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and\nnot present in `denied_values`.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a `Constraint`\n`constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of\n`list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.\nSuppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that\nrestricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a\n`Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has\n`inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,\nthen an attempt to activate any API will be denied.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for\n`projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`:\n\nExample 1 (no inherited values):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E3\" allowed_values: \"E4\"}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.\n\nExample 2 (inherited values):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {value: \"E3\" value: \"E4\" inherit_from_parent: true}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.\n\nExample 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {denied_values: \"E1\"}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.\n\nExample 4 (RestoreDefault):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {RestoreDefault: {}}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on\nthe value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if\n`DENY`, none).\n\nExample 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):\n  `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.\n  `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.\nThe accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on\nthe value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if\n`DENY`, none).\n\nExample 6 (ListConstraint allowing all):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {all: ALLOW}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.\nAny value is accepted at `projects/bar`.\n\nExample 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {all: DENY}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.\nNo value is accepted at `projects/bar`.\n\nExample 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy):\nGiven the following resource hierarchy\n  O1-\u003e{F1, F2}; F1-\u003e{P1}; F2-\u003e{P2, P3},\n  `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n    {allowed_values: \"under:organizations/O1\"}\n  `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n    {allowed_values: \"under:projects/P3\"}\n    {denied_values: \"under:folders/F2\"}\nThe accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`,\n  `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`,\n  `projects/P3`.\nThe accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`,\n  `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.",

For example,\ngroup@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in\nthe myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com\norganization.\n\n+ Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly\nwithout any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be\ninvited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.\n\n+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user\nmust be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must\nexplicitly accept the invitation.\n\n+ You can only grant ownership of a project to a member by using the\nGCP Console. Inviting a member will deliver an invitation email that\nthey must accept. An invitation email is not generated if you are\ngranting a role other than owner, or if both the member you are inviting\nand the project are part of your organization.\n\n+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have\naccepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.\n\n+ If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least\none owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the\npolicy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner\nfrom the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy\nprojects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to\nIAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is\nrectified.\n\nAuthorization requires the Google IAM permission\n`resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` on the project",
