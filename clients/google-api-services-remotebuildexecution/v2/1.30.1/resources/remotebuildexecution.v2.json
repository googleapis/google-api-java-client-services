The\nserver will run the action and eventually return the result.\n\nThe input `Action`'s fields MUST meet the various canonicalization\nrequirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has\nthe same digest as other logically equivalent `Action`s. The server MAY\nenforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is\nreceived. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the\nrequirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not\nverify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from\nanother logically equivalent action if they hash differently.\n\nReturns a stream of\ngoogle.longrunning.Operation messages\ndescribing the resulting execution, with eventual `response`\nExecuteResponse. The\n`metadata` on the operation is of type\nExecuteOperationMetadata.\n\nIf the client remains connected after the first response is returned after\nthe server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called\nWaitExecution\nuntil the execution completes or the request reaches an error. The\noperation can also be queried using Operations\nAPI.\n\nThe server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the\nOperations API.\n\nErrors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported\nas gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the\naction will be reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The\nserver MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto.\nThe possible errors include:\n\n* `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more arguments are invalid.\n* `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: One or more errors occurred in setting up the\n  action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being\n  available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry.\n* `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to run\n  the action.\n* `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a transient condition, such as all workers being\n  occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not\n  be started. The client should retry.\n* `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the\n  worker.\n* `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out.\n* `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled by the client.

That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but\n`size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.\n\nThe reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great\nmany cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work\nwith prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree\nstructures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could\nimplement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more\ncomplicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size\nup-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where\ndigests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation\ndetails of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but\nwe consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\nWhen a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the\nmessage in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and\nservers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following\nrules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message:\n\n* Fields are serialized in tag order.\n* There are no unknown fields.\n* There are no duplicate fields.\n* Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.\n\nMost protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when\nserializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance,\nconcatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.",

That is, it is\n  legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as\n  children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon\n  execution.\n* The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted\n  in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code\n  point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.\n\nA `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.\n\nAs an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a\ndirectory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened\nfor readability):\n\n```json\n// (Directory proto)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"bar\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\",\n        size: 65534\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  directories: [\n    {\n      name: \"foo\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4cf2eda940...\",\n        size: 43\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"baz\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"b2c941073e...\",\n        size: 1294,\n      },\n      is_executable: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
