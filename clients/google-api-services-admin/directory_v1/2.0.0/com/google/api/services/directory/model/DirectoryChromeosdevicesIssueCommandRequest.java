   * "volume": 50 }. The volume has to be an integer in the range [0,100]. *
   * `DEVICE_START_CRD_SESSION`: Payload is optionally a stringified JSON object in the form: {
   * "ackedUserPresence": true, "crdSessionType": string }. `ackedUserPresence` is a boolean. By
   * default, `ackedUserPresence` is set to `false`. To start a Chrome Remote Desktop session for an
   * active device, set `ackedUserPresence` to `true`. `crdSessionType` can only select from values
   * `private` (which grants the remote admin exclusive control of the ChromeOS device) or `shared`
   * (which allows the admin and the local user to share control of the ChromeOS device). If not
   * set, `crdSessionType` defaults to `shared`. The `FETCH_CRD_AVAILABILITY_INFO` command can be
   * used to determine available session types on the device. * `REBOOT`: Payload is a stringified
   * JSON object in the form: { "user_session_delay_seconds": 300 }. The
   * `user_session_delay_seconds` is the amount of seconds to wait before rebooting the device if a
   * user is logged in. It has to be an integer in the range [0,300]. When payload is not present
   * for reboot, 0 delay is the default. Note: This only applies if an actual user is logged in,
   * including a Guest. If the device is in the login screen or in Kiosk mode the value is not
   * respected and the device immediately reboots. * `FETCH_SUPPORT_PACKET`: Payload is optionally a
   * stringified JSON object in the form: {"supportPacketDetails":{ "issueCaseId":
   * optional_support_case_id_string, "issueDescription": optional_issue_description_string,
   * "requestedDataCollectors": []}} The list of available `data_collector_enums` are as following:

   * ChromeOS Platform Logs (5), Device Event (6), Intel WiFi NICs Debug Dump (7), Touch Events (8),
