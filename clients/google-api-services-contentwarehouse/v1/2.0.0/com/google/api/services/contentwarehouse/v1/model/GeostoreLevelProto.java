/**
 * A feature used to represent a logical level, e.g. floor. A feature belonging to a given level
 * should point to the level feature using relation RELATION_ON_LEVEL. The standard feature
 * properties are interpreted as follows: name - Levels should have names according to the
 * following: * Short, elevator-style names, such as "L" for "Lobby" and "2" for "Second floor",
 * must be included and must be tagged with FLAG_ABBREVIATED. There must be an unambiguous "best"
 * abbreviated name. * Longer names such as "Ticketing" or "Upper Level" may be present when the
 * level has a specific name. * Non-abbreviated names should only be added if they are known to
 * meaningfully expand upon the abbreviated name. For example, the long name "Observation Deck 2"
 * for the abbreviated name "OD2" is a good additional name. In contrast, the name "Level 2" for the
 * abbreviated name "2" is not desired. address - This should always be empty. point, polyline,
 * polygon, center - These should never be set (since we are representing a logical entity).
 * preferred_viewport - This should be the approximate extent of the level. child - This should
 * always be empty.
