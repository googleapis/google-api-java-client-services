/**
 * Below is some horrible ASCII art and a description of the components of a road sign.
 * +-------------------+ | A11 E50 Paris | | Chartres | +-------------------+ This sign would be
 * composed of four components (all of them text components, the only option we support for now).
 * The three in the first row would all have a "major_position" of zero. Their "minor_position"
 * values would be zero for "A11", one for "E50", and two for "Paris". The component in the second
 * row would have "major_position" value of one. This message provides the details of a single
 * component of a road sign. A component defines its position within a sign, its type, and its
 * content.
 *
