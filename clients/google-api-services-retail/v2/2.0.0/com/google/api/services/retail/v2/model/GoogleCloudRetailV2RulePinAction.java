/**
 * Pins one or more specified products to a specific position in the results. * Rule Condition: Must
 * specify non-empty Condition.query_terms (for search only) or Condition.page_categories (for
 * browse only), but can't specify both. * Action Input: mapping of `[pin_position, product_id]`
 * pairs (pin position uses 1-based indexing). * Action Result: Will pin products with matching ids
 * to the position specified in the final result order. Example: Suppose the query is `shoes`, the
 * Condition.query_terms is `shoes` and the pin_map has `{1, "pid1"}`, then product with `pid1` will
 * be pinned to the top position in the final results. If multiple PinActions are matched to a
 * single request the actions will be processed from most to least recently updated. Pins to
 * positions larger than the max allowed page size of 120 are not allowed.
