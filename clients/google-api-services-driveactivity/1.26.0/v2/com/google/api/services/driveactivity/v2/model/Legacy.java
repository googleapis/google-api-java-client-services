/**
 * A strategy which consolidates activities using the grouping rules from the legacy V1 Activity
 * API. Similar actions occurring within a window of time can be grouped across multiple targets
 * (such as moving a set of files at once) or multiple actors (such as several users editing the
 * same item). Grouping rules for this strategy are specific to each type of action.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Drive Activity API. For a detailed explanation see:
