/**
 * These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of disruption caused by an
 * upgrade. maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable.
 * maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily
 * for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes. (maxUnavailable +
 * maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same
 * time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from
 * old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays
 * within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool
 * with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes
 * simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet
 * upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that there are always at least 4 nodes available.
