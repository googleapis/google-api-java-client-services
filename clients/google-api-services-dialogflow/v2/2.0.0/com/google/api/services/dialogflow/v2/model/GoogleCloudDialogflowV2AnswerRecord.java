/**
 * Answer records are records to manage answer history and feedbacks for Dialogflow. Currently,
 * answer record includes: - human agent assistant article suggestion - human agent assistant faq
 * article It doesn't include: - `DetectIntent` intent matching - `DetectIntent` knowledge Answer
 * records are not related to the conversation history in the Dialogflow Console. A Record is
 * generated even when the end-user disables conversation history in the console. Records are
 * created when there's a human agent assistant suggestion generated. A typical workflow for
 * customers provide feedback to an answer is: 1. For human agent assistant, customers get
 * suggestion via ListSuggestions API. Together with the answers, AnswerRecord.name are returned to
 * the customers. 2. The customer uses the AnswerRecord.name to call the
 * AnswerRecords.UpdateAnswerRecord method to send feedback about a specific answer that they
 * believe is wrong.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
