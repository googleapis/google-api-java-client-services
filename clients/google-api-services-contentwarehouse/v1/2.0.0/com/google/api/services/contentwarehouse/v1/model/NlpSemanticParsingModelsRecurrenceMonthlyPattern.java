/**
 * Pattern for a MONTHLY recurrence. A MONTHLY recurrence may be specified in four different ways.
 * These fields should be set in a mutually exclusive way, i.e.: ((month_day OR last_day) XOR
 * (week_day AND (week_day_number OR last_week))) 1. Absolute days of the month (i.e. the 1st and
 * 15th) or relative day from the end of the month (i.e. -1 for last day, -2 for second-to-last
 * day). Set month_day. 2. [Deprecated] Relative last day of the month. Represented as a boolean
 * since the last absolute day number is dependent on the month. This is just a short-cut for
 * month_day=-1 and is deprecated. Set last_day=true. 3. The nth (or nth-last) specific weekday of
 * the month. For example, the 3rd Wednesday of the month. This represents the 3rd instance of a
 * Wednesday of the month, regardless of what weekday the month started on. It does not necessarily
 * mean the Wednesday on the 3rd week of the month. 4. [Deprecated] The last specific weekday of the
 * month. For example, the last Thursday of the month. This is a short-cut for week_day_number=-1.
 *
