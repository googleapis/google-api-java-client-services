/**
 * An access control list, derived from the above IAM policy binding, which contains a set of
 * resources and accesses. May include one item from each set to compose an access control entry.
 * NOTICE that there could be multiple access control lists for one IAM policy binding. The access
 * control lists are created based on resource and access combinations. For example, assume we have
 * the following cases in one IAM policy binding: - Permission P1 and P2 apply to resource R1 and
 * R2; - Permission P3 applies to resource R2 and R3; This will result in the following access
 * control lists: - AccessControlList 1: [R1, R2], [P1, P2] - AccessControlList 2: [R2, R3], [P3]
