/**
 * Configuration of the barge-in behavior. Barge-in instructs the API to return a detected utterance
 * at a proper time while the client is playing back the response audio from a previous request.
 * When the client sees the utterance, it should stop the playback and immediately get ready for
 * receiving the responses for the current request. The barge-in handling requires the client to
 * start streaming audio input as soon as it starts playing back the audio from the previous
 * response. The playback is modeled into two phases: * No barge-in phase: which goes first and
 * during which speech detection should not be carried out. * Barge-in phase: which follows the no
 * barge-in phase and during which the API starts speech detection and may inform the client that an
 * utterance has been detected. Note that no-speech event is not expected in this phase. The client
 * provides this configuration in terms of the durations of those two phases. The durations are
 * measured in terms of the audio length fromt the the start of the input audio. The flow goes like
 * below: --> Time without speech detection | utterance only | utterance or no-speech event | |
 * +-------------+ | +------------+ | +---------------+ ----------+ no barge-in +-|-+ barge-in +-|-+
 * normal period +----------- +-------------+ | +------------+ | +---------------+ No-speech event
 * is a response with END_OF_UTTERANCE without any transcript following up.
