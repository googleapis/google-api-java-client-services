Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: * name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `update_time = 1560208038000` * create_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `create_time = 1560208038000` * iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `resource_properties.my_property : \"\"` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-resource_properties.my_property : \"\"`"

The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: * name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `update_time = 1560208038000` * create_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `create_time = 1560208038000` * iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `resource_properties.my_property : \"\"` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-resource_properties.my_property : \"\"`",

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",
