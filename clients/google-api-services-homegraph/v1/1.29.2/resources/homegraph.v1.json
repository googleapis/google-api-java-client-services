Google creates the agent user and stores a mapping from the\n    `agent_user_id` -\u003e Google ID mapping. Google also\n    stores all of the user's devices under that Google ID.\n\nThe mapping from `agent_user_id` to Google ID is many to many, since one\nGoogle user can have multiple 3p accounts, and multiple Google users can\nmap to one `agent_user_id` (e.g., a husband and wife share one Nest account\nusername/password).\n\nThe third-party user's identity is passed in as `agent_user_id`.\nThe agent is identified by the JWT signed by the partner's service account.\n\nNote: Special characters (except \"/\") in `agent_user_id` must be\nURL-encoded.",
