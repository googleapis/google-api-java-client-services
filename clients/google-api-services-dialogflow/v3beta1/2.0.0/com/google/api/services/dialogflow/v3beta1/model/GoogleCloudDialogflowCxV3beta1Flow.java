/**
 * Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot agent. A flow consists of
 * many pages connected by the transition routes. Conversations always start with the built-in Start
 * Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the current
 * flow (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow will
 * bring the session back to the parent flow, where the sub flow is started. Usually, when a
 * transition route is followed by a matched intent, the intent will be "consumed". This means the
 * intent won't activate more transition routes. However, when the followed transition route moves
 * the conversation session into a different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be
 * consumed in the target flow.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Dialogflow API. For a detailed explanation see:
