/**
 * Earlier we used to populate just the affected_members list and inferred the new membership state
 * (roles didn't exist back then) from the Type. go/dynamite-finra required backend to know the
 * previous membership state to reconstruct membership history. The proper solution involved
 * cleaning up up Type enum, but it was used in many, many places. This was added as a stop-gap
 * solution to unblock FINRA without breaking everything. Later role update and target audience
 * update started relying on this to communicate information to clients about what transition
 * happened. So this is now required to be populated and should be in sync with affected_members for
 * new messages.
