/**
 * `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes
 * the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
 * in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack
 * and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo()) {
 * ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ...
 * if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in
 * Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo)
 * ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := {...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
 * ... foo := {} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods
 * provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type
 * URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type
 * URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z". # JSON The JSON representation
 * of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
 * additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message
 * Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { "@type":
 * "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName": , "lastName": } If the embedded message
 * type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded
 * adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for
 * message google.protobuf.Duration): { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
 * "value": "1.212s" }
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Tool Results API. For a detailed explanation
 * see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
