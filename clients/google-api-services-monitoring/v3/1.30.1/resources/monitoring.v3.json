The value of performance always falls into the range 0 \u003c= performance \u003c= 1. A custom SLI describes how to compute this ratio, whether this is by dividing values from a pair of time series, cutting a Distribution into good and bad counts, or counting time windows in which the service complies with a criterion.

This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example \"the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster\". This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.

However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed..If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT)\nbit bit\nBy byte\ns second\nmin minute\nh hour\nd dayPrefixes (PREFIX)\nk kilo (10^3)\nM mega (10^6)\nG giga (10^9)\nT tera (10^12)\nP peta (10^15)\nE exa (10^18)\nZ zetta (10^21)\nY yotta (10^24)\nm milli (10^-3)\nu micro (10^-6)\nn nano (10^-9)\np pico (10^-12)\nf femto (10^-15)\na atto (10^-18)\nz zepto (10^-21)\ny yocto (10^-24)\nKi kibi (2^10)\nMi mebi (2^20)\nGi gibi (2^30)\nTi tebi (2^40)\nPi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors:\n/ division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples,  kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never  have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at  query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value).\n. multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For  examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows:\nExpression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"/\" Component } ;\n\nComponent = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ]\n          | Annotation\n          | \"1\"\n          ;\n\nAnnotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ;\nNotes:\nAnnotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation  is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples,  {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s.\nNAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not  containing { or }.\n1 represents a unitary dimensionless  unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such  as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are  appropriate. For example, \"new users per day\" can be represented as  1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean \"5 new  users). Alternatively, \"thousands of page views per day\" would be  represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric  value of 5.3 would mean \"5300 page views per day\").\n% represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving  a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100,  and a metric value 3 means \"3 percent\").\n10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range  0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage  (so a metric value 0.03 means \"3 percent\").",

In other words, a group contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all the group's ancestors. A group without a parent can contain any monitored resource.For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags: \"environment\" and \"role\". A parent group has a filter, environment=\"production\". A child of that parent group has a filter, role=\"transcoder\". The parent group contains all instances in the production environment, regardless of their roles.
