/**
 * Fields are encoded independently, then escaped and delimited by appling the following rules in
 * order: - While the last remaining field is `ASC` or `UNSPECIFIED`, and encodes to the empty
 * string "", remove it. - In each remaining field, replace all null bytes `0x00` with the fixed
 * byte pair `{0x00, 0xFF}`. - If any remaining field encodes to the empty string "", replace it
 * with the fixed byte pair `{0x00, 0x00}`. - Append the fixed byte pair `{0x00, 0x01}` to each
 * remaining field, except for the last remaining field if it is `ASC`. - Bitwise negate all `DESC`
 * fields. - Concatenate the results, or emit the fixed byte pair `{0x00, 0x00}` if there are no
 * remaining fields to concatenate. Examples: ``` - STRUCT() -> "\00\00" - STRUCT("") -> "\00\00" -
 * STRUCT("", "") -> "\00\00" - STRUCT("", "B") -> "\00\00" + "\00\01" + "B" - STRUCT("A", "") ->
 * "A" - STRUCT("", "B", "") -> "\00\00" + "\00\01" + "B" - STRUCT("A", "", "C") -> "A" + "\00\01" +
 * "\00\00" + "\00\01" + "C" ``` Examples for struct with `DESC` fields: ``` - STRUCT("" DESC) ->
 * "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("" DESC, "") -> "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("" DESC, "",
 * "") -> "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("" DESC, "A") -> "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" + "A" -
 * STRUCT("A", "" DESC, "") -> "A" + "\00\01" + "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("", "A" DESC) ->
 * "\x00\x00" + "\x00\x01" + "\xBE" + "\xFF\xFE" ``` Since null bytes are always escaped, this
 * encoding can cause size blowup for encodings like `Int64.BigEndianBytes` that are likely to
 * produce many such bytes. Sorted mode: - Fields are encoded in sorted mode. - All values supported
 * by the field encodings are allowed. - Fields with unset or `UNSPECIFIED` order are treated as
 * `ASC`. - Element-wise order is preserved: `A < B` if `A[0] < B[0]`, or if `A[0] == B[0] && A[1] <
 * B[1]`, etc. Strict prefixes sort first. Distinct mode: - Fields are encoded in distinct mode. -
 * All values supported by the field encodings are allowed.
