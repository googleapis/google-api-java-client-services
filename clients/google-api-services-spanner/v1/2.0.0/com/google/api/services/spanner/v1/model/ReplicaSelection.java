 * The directed read replica selector. Callers must provide one or more of the following fields for
 * replica selection: * `location` - The location must be one of the regions within the multi-region
 * configuration of your database. * `type` - The type of the replica. Some examples of using
 * replica_selectors are: * `location:us-east1` --> The "us-east1" replica(s) of any available type
 * will be used to process the request. * `type:READ_ONLY` --> The "READ_ONLY" type replica(s) in
 * nearest . available location will be used to process the request. * `location:us-east1
 * type:READ_ONLY` --> The "READ_ONLY" type replica(s) in location "us-east1" will be used to
 * process the request.
