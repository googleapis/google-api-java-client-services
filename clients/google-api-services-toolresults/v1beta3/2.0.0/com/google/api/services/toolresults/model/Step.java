/**
 * A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to
 * represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a
 * compiler). Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some
 * operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let's consider that we have a continuous
 * build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates
 * a Execution with id 1 - user creates a TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user
 * update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and
 * returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of
 * TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to
 * COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable. Next tag: 27
