/**
 * An absolute point in time independent of timezone or calendar, based on the proto3 Timestamp
 * (//google/protobuf/timestamp.proto). IMPORTANT: The definition of Timestamp proto is being moved
 * to //assistant/api/core_types/governed/datetime_type.proto. All existing references will be
 * updated to point to the new location. If you are adding a reference, use the new one instead.
 * NOTE: THIS IS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED TO BE USED. It was originally defined separately from
 * google.protobuf.Timestamp due to incompatibility with proto2 syntax. The incompatibility issues
 * have since been resolved and so the Google-wide standard representation of
 * google.protobuf.Timestamp should be preferred. In fact, google.protobuf.* protos in general are
 * now recommended to be used in new APIs.
