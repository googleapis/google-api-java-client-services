If a variable is deleted while being watched, the `variableState` state is set to `DELETED` and the method returns the last known variable `value`. If you set the deadline for watching to a larger value than internal timeout (60 seconds), the current variable value is returned and the `variableState` will be `VARIABLE_STATE_UNSPECIFIED`. To learn more about creating a watcher, read the [Watching a Variable for Changes](/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/watching-a-variable) documentation.",
