/**
 * A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both:
 * [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind of the metric value. In no
 * case can the end time be earlier than the start time. For a GAUGE metric, the startTime value is
 * technically optional; if  no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the  end
 * time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both  start and end times are
 * specified, they must be identical. Such an  interval is valid only for GAUGE metrics, which are
 * point-in-time  measurements. For DELTA and CUMULATIVE metrics, the start time must be earlier
 * than the end time. In all cases, the start time of the next interval must be  at least a
 * millisecond after the end time of the previous interval.  Because the interval is closed, if the
 * start time of a new interval  is the same as the end time of the previous interval, data written
 * at the new start time could overwrite data written at the previous  end time.
 *
