/**
 * A set of (label, value) pairs that were removed from a Distribution time series during
 * aggregation and then added as an attachment to a Distribution.Exemplar.The full label set for the
 * exemplars is constructed by using the dropped pairs in combination with the label values that
 * remain on the aggregated Distribution time series. The constructed full label set can be used to
 * identify the specific entity, such as the instance or job, which might be contributing to a long-
 * tail. However, with dropped labels, the storage requirements are reduced because only the
 * aggregated distribution values for a large group of time series are stored.Note that there are no
 * guarantees on ordering of the labels from exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-
 * distribution in the same stream, and there may be duplicates. It is up to clients to resolve any
 * ambiguities.
