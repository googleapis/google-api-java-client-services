/**
 * An ImportJob can be used to create CryptoKeys and CryptoKeyVersions using pre-existing key
 * material, generated outside of Cloud KMS. When an ImportJob is created, Cloud KMS will generate a
 * "wrapping key", which is a public/private key pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also
 * known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process. The nature
 * of the wrapping key depends on the choice of import_method. When the wrapping key generation is
 * complete, the state will be set to ACTIVE and the public_key can be fetched. The fetched public
 * key can then be used to wrap your pre-existing key material. Once the key material is wrapped, it
 * can be imported into a new CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling
 * ImportCryptoKeyVersion. Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with a single ImportJob. Cloud
 * KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS
 * has access to the private key. An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created. Once expired,
 * Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped with the
 * ImportJob's public key. For more information, see [Importing a
 * key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/importing-a-key).
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API. For a
