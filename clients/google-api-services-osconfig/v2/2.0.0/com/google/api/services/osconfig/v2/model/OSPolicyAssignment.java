 * OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to apply a set of OS policies to a
 * dynamically targeted group of Compute Engine VM instances. An OS policy is used to define the
 * desired state configuration for a Compute Engine VM instance through a set of configuration
 * resources that provide capabilities such as installing or removing software packages, or
 * executing a script. For more information about the OS policy resource definitions and examples,
 * see [OS policy and OS policy assignment](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-configuration-
 * management/working-with-os-policies).
