/**
 * As video mutations are reconciled by Venom, we can tell if the ingredient did or did not reach
 * certain objectives. When processing has completed, all objectives will have a corresponding
 * transition. All transitions are reset for every mutation, but will take into account assets
 * outside of that mutation. For example, if Asset X fails, and was part of
 * "OBJECTIVE_PRIMARY_ASSETS_DONE", a rerun of Asset Y is destined to result in OUTCOME_FAILED,
 * regardless of the fate of Asset Y. Some phenonema have effects on most or all Objectives. For
 * example, a bad input file will result on OUTCOME_INFEASIBLE across the board (eventually, for now
 * it's just GO_LIVE and DO_ALL, work in progress), and a failure to produce Format 18 will cause
 * OUTCOME_FAILED across most Objectives.
 *
