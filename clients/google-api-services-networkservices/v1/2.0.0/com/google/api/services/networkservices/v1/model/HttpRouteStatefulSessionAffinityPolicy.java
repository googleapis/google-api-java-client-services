/**
 * The specification for cookie-based stateful session affinity where the date plane supplies a
 * “session cookie” with the name "GSSA" which encodes a specific destination host and each request
 * containing that cookie will be directed to that host as long as the destination host remains up
 * and healthy. The gRPC proxyless mesh library or sidecar proxy will manage the session cookie but
 * the client application code is responsible for copying the cookie from each RPC in the session to
 * the next.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
