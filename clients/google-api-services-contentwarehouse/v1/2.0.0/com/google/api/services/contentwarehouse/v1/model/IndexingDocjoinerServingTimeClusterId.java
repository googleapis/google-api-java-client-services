 * The serving cluster id metadata. Why we cluster the documents. The default value is UNKNOWN.

 * (e.g. translated pages, or paginated content). Those documents are not dup-clustered in
 * Alexandria so that all documents (and their tokens) are available to search queries. However,
 * those documents are assigned the same Serving-Time-Cluster-ID (on the same reasontype), which
 * during serving guarantees that only one of them is shown to the user.
