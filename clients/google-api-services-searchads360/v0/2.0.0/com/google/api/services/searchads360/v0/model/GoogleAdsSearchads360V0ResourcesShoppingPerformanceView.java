/**
 * Shopping performance view. Provides Shopping campaign and Performance Max campaign statistics
 * aggregated at several product dimension levels. Product dimension values from Merchant Center
 * such as brand, category, custom attributes, product condition, and product type will reflect the
 * state of each dimension as of the date and time when the corresponding event was recorded. The
 * number of impressions and clicks that `shopping_performance_view` returns stats for may be
 * different from campaign reports. `shopping_performance_view` shows impressions and clicks on
 * products appearing in ads, while campaign reports show impressions and clicks on the ads
 * themselves. Depending on the format, an ad can show from zero to several products, so the numbers
 * may not match. In Search Ads 360 UI, you can query impressions and clicks of products appearing
 * in ads by selecting a column from "Product attributes" in the report editor. For example,
 * selecting the "Brand" column is equivalent to selecting `segments.product_brand`.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Search Ads 360 Reporting API. For a detailed
 * explanation see:
