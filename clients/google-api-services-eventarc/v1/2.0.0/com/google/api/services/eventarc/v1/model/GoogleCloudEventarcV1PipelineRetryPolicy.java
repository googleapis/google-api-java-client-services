/**
 * The retry policy configuration for the Pipeline. The pipeline exponentially backs off in case the
 * destination is non responsive or returns a retryable error code. The default semantics are as
 * follows: The backoff starts with a 5 second delay and doubles the delay after each failed attempt
 * (10 seconds, 20 seconds, 40 seconds, etc.). The delay is capped at 60 seconds by default. Please
 * note that if you set the min_retry_delay and max_retry_delay fields to the same value this will
 * make the duration between retries constant.
