/**
 * Describes how a quota check failed. For example if a daily limit was exceeded for the calling
 * project, a service could respond with a QuotaFailure detail containing the project id and the
 * description of the quota limit that was exceeded. If the calling project hasn't enabled the
 * service in the developer console, then a service could respond with the project id and set
 * `service_disabled` to true. Also see RetryInfo and Help types for other details about handling a
 * quota failure.
