/**
 * A Service resource is a logical component of an application that can share state and communicate
 * in a secure fashion with other services. For example, an application that handles customer
 * requests might include separate services to handle tasks such as backend data analysis or API
 * requests from mobile devices. Each service has a collection of versions that define a specific
 * set of code used to implement the functionality of that service.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the App Engine Admin API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
