   *
   * For the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply:             -
   * You can only use the AND operator for joining        selectors.     - You can only use direct
   * equality comparison operator        (=) without any functions for each selector.     - You can
   * specify the metric in both the filter string and in the        metric field. However, if
   * specified in both places, the metric must        be identical.     - The monitored resource
   * type        determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is        a
   * gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to        include a separate TimeSeries for
   * each instance in a group. In such a        case, you cannot filter on resource labels.
   * If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects        this metric to contain
   * values that apply to the entire autoscaled        instance group and resource label filtering
   * can be performed to        point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon. This is
   * called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling.            If not specified, the
   * type defaults to        gce_instance.
   *
   * Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled
   * group or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
   * TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective
   * values to obtain its scaling value.
