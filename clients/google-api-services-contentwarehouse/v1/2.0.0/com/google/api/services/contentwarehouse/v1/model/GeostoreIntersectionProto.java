/**
 * A TYPE_INTERSECTION feature represents a common endpoint of one or more segments in a
 * transportation network at which the segments are connected. An intersection in the real world may
 * be more complicated than that (e.g., comprise multiple segment endpoints or have extra
 * attributes), which can be modeled with an additional TYPE_INTERSECTION_GROUP feature, if needed
 * (see intersectiongroup.proto). The standard feature properties are interpreted as follows: name -
 * This should always be empty. Intersections that have a "special" name (e.g. Reads Corner
 * intersection, PEI, Canada) should point to a separate TYPE_INTERSECTION_GROUP feature that
 * captures it. Intersections which are named according to their cross streets do not need this
 * requirement, since their name can be determined by looking at the routes associated with each
 * segment. address - This should always be empty. point - Specifies the center of the intersection.
 * This should be the last vertex of all the segments which terminate at this intersection. polyline
 * - This should always be empty. polygon - This should always be empty. child - This should always
 * be empty.
