/**
 * This option is based on the DICOM Standard's [Clean Descriptors
 * Option](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2018e/output/chtml/part15/sect_E.3.5.html), and the
 * `CleanText` `Action` is applied to all the specified fields. When cleaning text, the process
 * attempts to transform phrases matching any of the tags marked for removal (action codes D, Z, X,
 * and U) in the [Basic
 * Profile](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2018e/output/chtml/part15/chapter_E.html). These
 * contextual phrases are replaced with the token "[CTX]". This option uses an additional infoType
 * during inspection.
