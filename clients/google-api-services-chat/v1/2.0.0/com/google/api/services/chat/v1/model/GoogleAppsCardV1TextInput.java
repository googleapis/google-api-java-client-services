 * A field in which users can enter text. Supports suggestions and on-change actions. Supports form
 * submission validation. When `Action.all_widgets_are_required` is set to `true` or this widget is

 * entered. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a field in which a user can enter
 * text](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-
 * dialog#add_a_field_in_which_a_user_can_enter_text). Chat apps receive and can process the value
 * of entered text during form input events. For details about working with form inputs, see
 * [Receive form data](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/read-form-data). When you need
 * to collect undefined or abstract data from users, use a text input. To collect defined or
 * enumerated data from users, use the SelectionInput widget. [Google Workspace add-ons and Chat
