 * This message describes roughly what a surface is capable of doing and metadata around those

 * physical device. The list of supported surfaces can be found in the

 * An example would be ANDROID_ALLO running on Pixel. Allo does not support AudioInput while the
 * Pixel does. In this case, audio_input will be set to false for Assistant Allo requests while it
 * might be set to true for OPA_NEXUS requests. Next ID: 35
