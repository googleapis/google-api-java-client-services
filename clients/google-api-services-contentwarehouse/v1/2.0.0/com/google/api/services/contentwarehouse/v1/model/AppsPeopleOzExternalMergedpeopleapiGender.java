/**
 * Gender in PeopleApi has some odd semantics about writing and reading that are not obvious from
 * the proto definition. First, the `type` string, when read, always maps to the constrained domain
 * of "male", "female", and "other", aside from a pathological case that PeopleApi would like to
 * fix. There are two typical patterns: 1. `type` is either "male" or "female" and `custom_type` and
 * `address_me_as` are exactly as specified by an update to PeopleApi, although they are most often
 * absent for "male" and "female" writes. 2. `type` is "other" and `custom_type` is set to a
 * freeform string from the request. `address_me_as` is equal to whatever was provided at write
 * time. When writing, the free-form string for `custom_type` can come from either `custom_type` if
 * the field is present on the request, or if `custom_type` is absent, the string value of `type`
 * will be copied into it. Any value in `type` will be coerced to "other" and the free-form value
 * will be copied into `custom_type`, even if `type` is exactly "other". Prefer to explicitly set
 * `custom_type` and set type to "other" instead of setting type to a free-form value. There are
 * weird edge cases when the value is "unknown". Consider the behavior for `type` == "unknown"
 * unspecified. Clients reading the gender should use the value from `formatted_type` if `type` is
 * "male" or "female". If `type` is "other", `formatted_type` will be "Other" (or some translation)
 * and clients should read `custom_type` for more specificity.
 *
