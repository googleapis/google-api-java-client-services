/**
 * Represents a principal who has authenticated as any kind of user which the application
 * understands. This is typically used for "wiki-like" security, where anyone is allowed access so
 * long as they can be held accountable for that access. Since the purpose is knowing whom to blame,
 * it is up to the application to decide what kinds of users it knows how to blame. For example, an
 * application might choose to include GAIA users in "all authenticated users", but not include MDB
 * users. Nothing here.
