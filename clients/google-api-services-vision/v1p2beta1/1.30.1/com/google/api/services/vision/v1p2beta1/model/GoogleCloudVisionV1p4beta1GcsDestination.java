   * was no filename prefix specified.
   *
   * If multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each of which contains some
   * subset of the full list of AnnotateImageResponse. Multiple outputs can happen if, for example,
   * the output JSON is too large and overflows into multiple sharded files.
