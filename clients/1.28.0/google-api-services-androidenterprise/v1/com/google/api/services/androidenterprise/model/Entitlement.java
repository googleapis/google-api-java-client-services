/**
 * The presence of an Entitlements resource indicates that a user has the right to use a particular
 * app. Entitlements are user specific, not device specific. This allows a user with an entitlement
 * to an app to install the app on all their devices. It's also possible for a user to hold an
 * entitlement to an app without installing the app on any device.
 *
 * The API can be used to create an entitlement. As an option, you can also use the API to trigger
 * the installation of an app on all a user's managed devices at the same time the entitlement is
 * created.
 *
 * If the app is free, creating the entitlement also creates a group license for that app. For paid
 * apps, creating the entitlement consumes one license, and that license remains consumed until the
 * entitlement is removed. If the enterprise hasn't purchased enough licenses, then no entitlement
 * is created and the installation fails. An entitlement is also not created for an app if the app
 * requires permissions that the enterprise hasn't accepted.
 *
 * If an entitlement is deleted, the app may be uninstalled from a user's device. As a best
 * practice, uninstall the app by calling  Installs.delete() before deleting the entitlement.
 *
 * Entitlements for apps that a user pays for on an unmanaged profile have "userPurchase" as the
 * entitlement reason. These entitlements cannot be removed via the API.
 *
