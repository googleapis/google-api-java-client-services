/**
 * Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to specify access control
 * policies for Cloud Platform resources.
 *
 * A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of `members` to a `role`,
 * where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A
 * `role` is a named list of permissions defined by IAM.
 *
 * **JSON Example**
 *
 *     {       "bindings": [         {           "role": "roles/owner",           "members": [
 * "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",             "domain:google.com",
 * "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"           ]         },         {
 * "role": "roles/viewer",           "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]         }       ]     }
 *
 * **YAML Example**
 *
 *     bindings:     - members:       - user:mike@example.com       - group:admins@example.com
 * - domain:google.com       - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com       role:
 * roles/owner     - members:       - user:sean@example.com       role: roles/viewer
 *
 * For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM developer's
 * guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).
 *
