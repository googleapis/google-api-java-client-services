/**
 * An object representing a resource that can be used for monitoring, logging, billing, or other
 * purposes. Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as
 * disks. The type field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the
 * resource's schema. Information in the labels field identifies the actual resource and its
 * attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be
 * represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for "gce_instance"
 * has labels "project_id", "instance_id" and "zone": { "type": "gce_instance", "labels": {
 * "project_id": "my-project", "instance_id": "12345678901234", "zone": "us-central1-a" }}
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
