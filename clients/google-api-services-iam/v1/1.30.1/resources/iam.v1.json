If an application uses the service account to authenticate, that application can no longer call Google APIs or access Google Cloud resources. Existing access tokens for the service account are rejected, and requests for new access tokens will fail. To re-enable the service account, use EnableServiceAccount. After you re-enable the service account, its existing access tokens will be accepted, and you can request new access tokens. To help avoid unplanned outages, we recommend that you disable the service account before you delete it. Use this method to disable the service account, then wait at least 24 hours and watch for unintended consequences. If there are no unintended consequences, you can delete the service account with DeleteServiceAccount.",
