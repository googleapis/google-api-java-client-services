/**
 * An Attachment represents a linked entity associated with a piece of social content. This may be a
 * 1st-party or 3rd-party entity. In the Papyrus context, an Attachment is part of a Cent, and sits
 * alongside the main content of the cent, which is represented as a sequence of Segments. Right now
 * an Attachment is just a wrapper around an Embed, but we provide the extra layer of abstraction
 * since, as Embeds move to separate storage in Briefcase, we may want to add additional fields that
 * are not part of the Embed proper, but that (for example) relate to the usage of the linked
 * content within the particular post/cent.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the contentwarehouse API. For a detailed explanation see:
