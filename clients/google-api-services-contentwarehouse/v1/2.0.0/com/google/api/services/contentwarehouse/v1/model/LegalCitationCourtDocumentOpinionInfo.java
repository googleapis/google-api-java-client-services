 * A variety of opinions may be published as a single document. We have one OpinionInfo for each

 * (judegment) of the majority of the court, however, he may not agree with the argument in the
 * primary opinion. If multiple judges "concur" or "dissent" the primary opinion, then one judge
 * delivers their opinion, and other judges are said to "join" him.
