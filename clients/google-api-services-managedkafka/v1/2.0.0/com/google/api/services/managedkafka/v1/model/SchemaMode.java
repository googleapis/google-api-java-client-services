/**
 * SchemaMode represents the mode of a schema registry or a specific subject. Four modes are
 * supported: * NONE: deprecated. This was the default mode for a subject, but now the default is
 * unset (which means use the global schema registry setting) * READONLY: The schema registry is in
 * read-only mode. * READWRITE: The schema registry is in read-write mode, which allows limited
 * write operations on the schema. * IMPORT: The schema registry is in import mode, which allows
 * more editing operations on the schema for data importing purposes.
