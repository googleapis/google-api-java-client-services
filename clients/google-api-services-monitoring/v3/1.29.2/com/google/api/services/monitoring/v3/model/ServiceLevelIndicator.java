/**
 * A Service-Level Indicator (SLI) describes the "performance" of a service. For some services, the
 * SLI is well-defined. In such cases, the SLI can be described easily by referencing the well-known
 * SLI and providing the needed parameters. Alternatively, a "custom" SLI can be defined with a
 * query to the underlying metric store. An SLI is defined to be good_service / total_service over
 * any queried time interval. The value of performance always falls into the range 0 <= performance
 * <= 1. A custom SLI describes how to compute this ratio, whether this is by dividing values from a
 * pair of time series, cutting a Distribution into good and bad counts, or counting time windows in
 * which the service complies with a criterion. For separation of concerns, a single Service-Level
 * Indicator measures performance for only one aspect of service quality, such as fraction of
 * successful queries or fast-enough queries.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
