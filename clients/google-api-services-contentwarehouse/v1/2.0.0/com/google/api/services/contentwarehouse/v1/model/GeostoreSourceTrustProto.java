 * Trust related information about the input source (feed or user) to help feature summarization.

 * blocked LBC user or a trusted feed) or their status (Google hired operator or admin user). The
 * proto can later contain a more granular trust score or correctness probabilities. A higher enum
 * value indicates a more trusted source. Leaving room in the value space for adding more granular
 * enums, if they become necessary later.
