/**
 * A packed representation of a 2D grid of uniformly spaced points containing elevation data. Each
 * point within the grid represents the altitude in meters above average sea level at that location
 * within the tile. Elevations provided are (generally) relative to the EGM96 geoid, however some
 * areas will be relative to NAVD88. EGM96 and NAVD88 are off by no more than 2 meters. The grid is
 * oriented north-west to south-east, as illustrated: rows[0].a[0] rows[0].a[m] +-----------------+
 * | | | N | | ^ | | | | | W <-----> E | | | | | v | | S | | | +-----------------+ rows[n].a[0]
 * rows[n].a[m] Rather than storing the altitudes directly, we store the diffs between them as
 * integers at some requested level of precision to take advantage of integer packing. The actual
 * altitude values a[] can be reconstructed using the scale and each row's first_altitude and
 * altitude_diff fields. More details in go/elevation-encoding-options-for-enduro under "Recommended
 * implementation".
