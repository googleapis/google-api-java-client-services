/**
 * Declares an API Interface to be included in this interface. The including interface must
 * redeclare all the methods from the included interface, but documentation and options are
 * inherited as follows: - If after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation string of
 * the redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited from the original method. - Each annotation
 * belonging to the service config (http, visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will
 * be inherited. - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be modified as follows.
 * Any version prefix will be replaced by the version of the including interface plus the root path
 * if specified. Example of a simple mixin: package google.acl.v1; service AccessControl { // Get
 * the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get
 * = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl"; } } package google.storage.v2; service Storage { // rpc
 * GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl); // Get a data record. rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns
 * (Data) { option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}"; } } Example of a mixin
 * configuration: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name:
 * google.acl.v1.AccessControl The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
 * also declared with same name and request/response types in `Storage`. A documentation generator
 * or annotation processor will see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting
 * documentation and annotations as follows: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc
 * GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl";
 * } ... } Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`. If the `root` field
 * in the mixin is specified, it should be a relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are
 * placed. Example: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name:
 * google.acl.v1.AccessControl root: acls This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:
 * service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 * option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl"; } ... }
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Service Networking API. For a detailed explanation
