 * A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery. Retry delay will be exponential

 * acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message. Retry Policy is implemented on a
 * best effort basis. At times, the delay between consecutive deliveries may not match the
 * configuration. That is, delay can be more or less than configured backoff.
