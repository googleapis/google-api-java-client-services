 * The `TermsOfService` message represents a specific version of the terms of service that merchants

 * Service](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160173). This message is important for the
 * onboarding process, ensuring that merchants agree to the necessary legal agreements for using the
 * service. Merchants can retrieve the latest terms of service for a given `kind` and `region`
 * through `RetrieveLatestTermsOfService`, and accept them as required through
 * `AcceptTermsOfService`.
