For example, if your job is configured to run every day at 1pm and you cancel Monday's operation at 1:05pm, Monday's transfer will stop. However, a transfer job will still be attempted on Tuesday. This applies only to currently running operations. If an operation is not currently running, `cancel` does nothing. *Caution:* Canceling a transfer job can leave your data in an unknown state. We recommend that you restore the state at both the destination and the source after the `cancel` request completes so that your data is in a consistent state. When you cancel a job, the next job computes a delta of files and may repair any inconsistent state. For instance, if you run a job every day, and today's job found 10 new files and transferred five files before you canceled the job, tomorrow's transfer operation will compute a new delta with the five files that were not copied today plus any new files discovered tomorrow.",

For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields: * **HTTP URL** — The location of the object. * **Length** — The size of the object in bytes. * **MD5** — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object. For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object will not be transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer will fail. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer."
