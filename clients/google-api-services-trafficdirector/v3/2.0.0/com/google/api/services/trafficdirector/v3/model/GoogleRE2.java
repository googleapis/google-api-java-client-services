/**
 * Google's `RE2 `_ regex engine. The regex string must adhere to the documented `syntax `_. The
 * engine is designed to complete execution in linear time as well as limit the amount of memory
 * used. Envoy supports program size checking via runtime. The runtime keys
 * ``re2.max_program_size.error_level`` and ``re2.max_program_size.warn_level`` can be set to
 * integers as the maximum program size or complexity that a compiled regex can have before an
 * exception is thrown or a warning is logged, respectively. ``re2.max_program_size.error_level``
 * defaults to 100, and ``re2.max_program_size.warn_level`` has no default if unset (will not
 * check/log a warning). Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size of regexes: the
 * histogram ``re2.program_size``, which records the program size, and the counter
 * ``re2.exceeded_warn_level``, which is incremented each time the program size exceeds the warn
 * level threshold.
 *
