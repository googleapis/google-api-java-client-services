   * attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can

   * credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is
   * 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 4KB.
   * For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the `google.subject`
