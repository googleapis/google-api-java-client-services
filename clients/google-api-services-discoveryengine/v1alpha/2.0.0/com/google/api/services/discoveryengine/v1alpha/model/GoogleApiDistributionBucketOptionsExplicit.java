/**
 * Specifies a set of buckets with arbitrary widths. There are `size(bounds) + 1` (= N) buckets.
 * Bucket `i` has the following boundaries: Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): bounds[i] Lower bound (1 <=
 * i < N); bounds[i - 1] The `bounds` field must contain at least one element. If `bounds` has only
 * one element, then there are no finite buckets, and that single element is the common boundary of
 * the overflow and underflow buckets.
 *
