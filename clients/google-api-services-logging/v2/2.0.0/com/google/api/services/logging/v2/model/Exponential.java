/**
 * Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that is proportional to the value
 * of the lower bound. Each bucket represents a constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in
 * the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following
 * boundaries:Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): scale * (growth_factor ^ i).Lower bound (1 <= i < N):
 * scale * (growth_factor ^ (i - 1)).
