/**
 * The response for ExecuteBatchDml. Contains a list of ResultSet messages, one for each DML
 * statement that has successfully executed, in the same order as the statements in the request. If
 * a statement fails, the status in the response body identifies the cause of the failure. To check
 * for DML statements that failed, use the following approach: 1. Check the status in the response
 * message. The google.rpc.Code enum value `OK` indicates that all statements were executed
 * successfully. 2. If the status was not `OK`, check the number of result sets in the response. If
 * the response contains `N` ResultSet messages, then statement `N+1` in the request failed. Example
 * 1: * Request: 5 DML statements, all executed successfully. * Response: 5 ResultSet messages, with
 * the status `OK`. Example 2: * Request: 5 DML statements. The third statement has a syntax error.
 * * Response: 2 ResultSet messages, and a syntax error (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`) status. The number of
 * ResultSet messages indicates that the third statement failed, and the fourth and fifth statements
 * were not executed.
 *
