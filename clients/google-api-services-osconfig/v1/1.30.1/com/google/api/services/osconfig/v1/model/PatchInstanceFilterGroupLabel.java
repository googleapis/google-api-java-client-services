/**
 * Targets a group of VM instances by using their [assigned

 * `GroupLabel` is a combination of labels that is used to target VMs for a patch job. For example,
 * a patch job can target VMs that have the following `GroupLabel`: `{"env":"test", "app":"web"}`.
 * This means that the patch job is applied to VMs that have both the labels `env=test` and
 * `app=web`.
