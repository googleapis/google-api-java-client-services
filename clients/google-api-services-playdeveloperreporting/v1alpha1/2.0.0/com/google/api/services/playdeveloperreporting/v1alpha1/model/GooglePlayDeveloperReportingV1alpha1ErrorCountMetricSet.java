/**
 * Singleton resource representing the set of error report metrics. This metric set contains un-
 * normalized error report counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * HOURLY: metrics are
 * aggregated in hourly intervals. The default and only supported timezone is `UTC`. * DAILY:
 * metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. The default and only supported timezone is
 * `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `errorReportCount` (`google.type.Decimal`):
 * Absolute count of individual error reports that have been received for an app. * `distinctUsers`
 * (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users for which reports have been received. Care must
 * be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple
 * times. This value is not rounded, however it may be an approximation. **Required dimension:**
 * This dimension must be always specified in all requests in the `dimensions` field in query
 * requests. * `reportType` (string): the type of error. The value should correspond to one of the
 * possible values in ErrorType. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of
 * Android that was running on the user's device, e.g., 26. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the
 * app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the
 * user's device model. The form of the identifier is 'deviceBrand/device', where deviceBrand
 * corresponds to Build.BRAND and device corresponds to Build.DEVICE, e.g., google/coral. *
 * `deviceType` (string): identifier of the device's form factor, e.g., PHONE. * `issueId` (string):
 * the id an error was assigned to. The value should correspond to the `{issue}` component of the
 * issue name. * `deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.). *
 * `deviceSocMake` (string): Make of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., Samsung.
 * [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MANUFACTURER) *
 * `deviceSocModel` (string): Model of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., "Exynos 2100".
 * [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MODEL) * `deviceCpuMake`
 * (string): Make of the device's CPU, e.g., Qualcomm. * `deviceCpuModel` (string): Model of the
 * device's CPU, e.g., "Kryo 240". * `deviceGpuMake` (string): Make of the device's GPU, e.g., ARM.
 * * `deviceGpuModel` (string): Model of the device's GPU, e.g., Mali. * `deviceGpuVersion`
 * (string): Version of the device's GPU, e.g., T750. * `deviceVulkanVersion` (string): Vulkan
 * version of the device, e.g., "4198400". * `deviceGlEsVersion` (string): OpenGL ES version of the
 * device, e.g., "196610". * `deviceScreenSize` (string): Screen size of the device, e.g., NORMAL,
 * LARGE. * `deviceScreenDpi` (string): Screen density of the device, e.g., mdpi, hdpi. **Required
 * permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-
 * only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** * vitals.errors.counts contains
 * normalized metrics about Crashes, another stability metric. * vitals.errors.counts contains
 * normalized metrics about ANRs, another stability metric.
