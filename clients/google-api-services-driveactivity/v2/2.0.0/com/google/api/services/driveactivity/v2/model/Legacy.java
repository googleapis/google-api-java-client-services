/**
 * A strategy that consolidates activities using the grouping rules from the legacy V1 Activity API.
 * Similar actions occurring within a window of time can be grouped across multiple targets (such as
 * moving a set of files at once) or multiple actors (such as several users editing the same item).
 * Grouping rules for this strategy are specific to each type of action.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Drive Activity API. For a detailed explanation see:
 * <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-http-java-client/json</a>
