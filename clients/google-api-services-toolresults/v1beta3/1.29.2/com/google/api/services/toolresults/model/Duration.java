/**
 * A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and
 * fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts
 * like "day" or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp
 * values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately
 * +-10,000 years.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
 *
 * Timestamp start = ...; Timestamp end = ...; Duration duration = ...;
 *
 * duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds; duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
 *
 * if (duration.seconds  0) { duration.seconds += 1; duration.nanos -= 1000000000; } else if
 * (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) { duration.seconds -= 1; duration.nanos +=
 * 1000000000; }
 *
 * Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
 *
 * Timestamp start = ...; Duration duration = ...; Timestamp end = ...;
 *
 * end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds; end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
 *
 * if (end.nanos = 1000000000) { end.seconds += 1; end.nanos -= 1000000000; }
 *
 * Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
 *
 * td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10) duration = Duration() duration.FromTimedelta(td)
 *
 * # JSON Mapping
 *
 * In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an object, where the string
 * ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and is preceded by the number of seconds, with
 * nanoseconds expressed as fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
 * encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should be expressed in JSON
 * format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1 microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as
 * "3.000001s".
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Tool Results API. For a detailed explanation
 * see:
