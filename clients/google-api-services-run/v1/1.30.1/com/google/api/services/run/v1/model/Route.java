 * Route is responsible for configuring ingress over a collection of Revisions. Some of the
 * Revisions a Route distributes traffic over may be specified by referencing the Configuration
 * responsible for creating them; in these cases the Route is additionally responsible for
 * monitoring the Configuration for "latest ready" revision changes, and smoothly rolling out latest
 * revisions. See also: https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/overview.md#route
 *
 * Cloud Run currently supports referencing a single Configuration to automatically deploy the
 * "latest ready" Revision from that Configuration.
