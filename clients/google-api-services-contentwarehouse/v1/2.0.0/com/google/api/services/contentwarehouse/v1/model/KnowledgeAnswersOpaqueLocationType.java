/**
 * A LocationType configures a value whose type is a Location message, for example, the output of
 * the Location subgrammar. Note that this location type is not the same as a "location entity" (an
 * entity with a location indicating type/collection, which is annotated by QRef). The scope of a
 * LocationType is usually broader than a location entity, it may represent - businesses, places,
 * and POIs (location entities from QRef) - addresses ("123 Main St., New York, NY") or even just
 * coordinates (latitude, longitude) - business categories (e.g., "pharmacies" or "gas stations") -
 * SAFT locations - aliases (including "home" and "work") - contacts - combinations of a location
 * with modifiers and constraints (e.g., "chinese restaurant near me" or "cheap kid-friendly
 * hotels") - ungrounded locations produced by ungrounded_location model See go/location-type for
 * the details of the location proto output by location subgrammar.
