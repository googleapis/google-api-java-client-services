/**
 * Conditions that determine which objects are transferred. Applies only to Cloud Data Sources such
 * as S3, Azure, and Cloud Storage. The "last modification time" refers to the time of the last
 * change to the object's content or metadata — specifically, this is the `updated` property of
 * Cloud Storage objects, the `LastModified` field of S3 objects, and the `Last-Modified` header of
 * Azure blobs. For S3 objects, the `LastModified` value is the time the object begins uploading. If
 * the object meets your "last modification time" criteria, but has not finished uploading, the
 * object is not transferred. See [Transfer from Amazon S3 to Cloud
 * Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-
 * transfers/agentless/s3#transfer_options) for more information. Transfers with a PosixFilesystem
 * source or destination don't support `ObjectConditions`.

 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
