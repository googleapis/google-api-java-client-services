/**
 * Configuration for a `WorkerPool`. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general

 * Build will use a worker from this pool. If your build needs access to resources on a private
 * network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds. Private `WorkerPool`s give your builds
 * access to any single VPC network that you administer, including any on-prem resources connected
 * to that VPC network. For an overview of private pools, see [Private pools
 * overview](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/private-pools-overview).
