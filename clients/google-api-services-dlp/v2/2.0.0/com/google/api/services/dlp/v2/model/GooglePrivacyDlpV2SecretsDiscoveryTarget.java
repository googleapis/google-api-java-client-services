 * secrets daily. No inspect template should be included in the discovery config for a security
 * benchmarks scan. Instead, the built-in list of secrets and credentials infoTypes will be used
 * (see https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/infotypes-
 * reference#credentials_and_secrets). Credentials and secrets discovered will be reported as
 * vulnerabilities to Security Command Center.
