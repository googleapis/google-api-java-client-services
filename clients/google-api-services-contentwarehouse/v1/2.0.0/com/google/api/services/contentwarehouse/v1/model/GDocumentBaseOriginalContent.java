/**
 * The original, unconverted document, typically PDF or Word. Copied from OriginalDoc field of
 * doclogs. Unlike "Content", this does not contain any HTTP headers. The content may be compressed
 * using the same method as "Content". In practice it is only compressed in the Teragoogle index. It
 * is never compressed in docjoins because those are compressed at the sstable level. In doclogs
 * content will only be compressed if the Trawler fetchreply is also compressed--which is currently
 * never and unlikely to change for performance reasons.
 *

 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Document AI Warehouse API. For a detailed explanation
