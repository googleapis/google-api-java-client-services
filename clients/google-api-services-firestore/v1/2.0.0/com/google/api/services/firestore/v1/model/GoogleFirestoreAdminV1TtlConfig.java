 * The TTL (time-to-live) configuration for documents that have this `Field` set. Storing a
 * timestamp value into a TTL-enabled field will be treated as the document's absolute expiration
 * time. For Enterprise edition databases, the timestamp value may also be stored in an array value
 * in the TTL-enabled field. Timestamp values in the past indicate that the document is eligible for
 * immediate expiration. Using any other data type or leaving the field absent will disable
 * expiration for the individual document.
