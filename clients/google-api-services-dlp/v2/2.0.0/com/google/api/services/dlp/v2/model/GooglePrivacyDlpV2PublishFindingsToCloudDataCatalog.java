/**
 * Publish findings of a DlpJob to Data Catalog. In Data Catalog, tag templates are applied to the
 * resource that Cloud DLP scanned. Data Catalog tag templates are stored in the same project and
 * region where the BigQuery table exists. For Cloud DLP to create and apply the tag template, the
 * Cloud DLP service agent must have the `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateOwner` permission on the
 * project. The tag template contains fields summarizing the results of the DlpJob. Any field values
 * previously written by another DlpJob are deleted. InfoType naming patterns are strictly enforced
 * when using this feature. Findings are persisted in Data Catalog storage and are governed by
 * service-specific policies for Data Catalog. For more information, see [Service Specific
 * Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms). Only a single instance of this action can
 * be specified. This action is allowed only if all resources being scanned are BigQuery tables.
 * Compatible with: Inspect
