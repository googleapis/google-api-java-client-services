Technically, the server could\nimplement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more\ncomplicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size\nup-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where\ndigests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation\ndetails of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but\nwe consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\nWhen a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the\nmessage in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and\nservers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following\nrules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message:\n\n* Fields are serialized in tag order.\n* There are no unknown fields.\n* There are no duplicate fields.\n* Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.\n\nMost protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when\nserializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts.

That is, it is\n  legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as\n  children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon\n  execution.\n* The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted\n  in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code\n  point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.\n* The NodeProperties of files,\n  directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by\n  property name.\n\nA `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.\n\nAs an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a\ndirectory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened\nfor readability):\n\n```json\n// (Directory proto)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"bar\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\",\n        size: 65534\n      },\n      node_properties: [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"MTime\",\n          \"value\": \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  directories: [\n    {\n      name: \"foo\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4cf2eda940...\",\n        size: 43\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"baz\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"b2c941073e...\",\n        size: 1294,\n      },\n      is_executable: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
