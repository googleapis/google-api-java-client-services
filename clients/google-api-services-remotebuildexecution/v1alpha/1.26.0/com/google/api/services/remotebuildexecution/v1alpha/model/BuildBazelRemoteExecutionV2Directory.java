/**
 * A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or more children
 * FileNodes, DirectoryNodes and SymlinkNodes. Each `Node` contains its name in the directory,
 * either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target,
 * as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory.
 *
 * In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following
 * restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`:
 *
 * * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.   Multiple levels of
 * directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path
 * segment (file name).   Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where
 * the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is   legal to call the API
 * with a Directory that has both "Foo" and "foo" as   children, but the Action may be rejected by
 * the remote system upon   execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must
 * each be sorted   in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code
 * point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.
 *
 * A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.
 *
 * As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo`
 * with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened for readability):
 *
 * ```json // (Directory proto) {   files: [     {       name: "bar",       digest: {         hash:
 * "4a73bc9d03...",         size: 65534       }     }   ],   directories: [     {       name: "foo",
 * digest: {         hash: "4cf2eda940...",         size: 43       }     }   ] }
 *
 * // (Directory proto with hash "4cf2eda940..." and size 43) {   files: [     {       name: "baz",
 * digest: {         hash: "b2c941073e...",         size: 1294,       },       is_executable: true
 * }   ] } ```
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Remote Build Execution API. For a detailed
 * explanation see:
