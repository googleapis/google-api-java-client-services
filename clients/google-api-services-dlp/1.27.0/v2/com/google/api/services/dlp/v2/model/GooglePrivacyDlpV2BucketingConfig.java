/**
 * Generalization function that buckets values based on ranges. The ranges and replacement values
 * are dynamically provided by the user for custom behavior, such as 1-30 -> LOW 31-65 -> MEDIUM
 * 66-100 -> HIGH This can be used on data of type: number, long, string, timestamp. If the bound
 * `Value` type differs from the type of data being transformed, we will first attempt converting
 * the type of the data to be transformed to match the type of the bound before comparing. See
 * https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/concepts-bucketing to learn more.
