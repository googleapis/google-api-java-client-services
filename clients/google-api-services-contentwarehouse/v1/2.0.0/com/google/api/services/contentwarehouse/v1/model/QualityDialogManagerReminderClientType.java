/**
 * Define Reminder Client Type. This field is for the purposes of 1) UX Customization: Reminder
 * frontends can be configured to have a slightly different UX (e.g., A customized button on
 * Hubpage. A customized notification layout.) 2) Metrics: Client can count how many Reminders with
 * a certain client type are retrieved/mutated. (e.g., VEIDs in go/oparaw.) 3) Index: ListReminder
 * can list all Reminders with a certain client type. 4) Visibility control: some frontends
 * (identified by provenance type, shortn/_xVC9nY2Eb8) only have access to a subset of client types.
