/**
 * A playlist resource represents a YouTube playlist. A playlist is a collection of videos that can
 * be viewed sequentially and shared with other users. A playlist can contain up to 200 videos, and
 * YouTube does not limit the number of playlists that each user creates. By default, playlists are
 * publicly visible to other users, but playlists can be public or private.
 *
 * YouTube also uses playlists to identify special collections of videos for a channel, such as:   -
 * uploaded videos  - favorite videos  - positively rated (liked) videos  - watch history  - watch
 * later  To be more specific, these lists are associated with a channel, which is a collection of a
 * person, group, or company's videos, playlists, and other YouTube information. You can retrieve
 * the playlist IDs for each of these lists from the  channel resource for a given channel.
 *
 * You can then use the   playlistItems.list method to retrieve any of those lists. You can also add
 * or remove items from those lists by calling the   playlistItems.insert and   playlistItems.delete
 * methods.
 *
