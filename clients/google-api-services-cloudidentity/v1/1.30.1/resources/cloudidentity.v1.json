[Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the ClientState in format: `devices/{device_id}/deviceUsers/{device_user_id}/clientState/{partner_id}`, where partner_id corresponds to the partner storing the data. For partners belonging to the \"BeyondCorp Alliance\", this is the partner ID specified to you by Google. For all other callers, this is a string of the form: `{customer_id}-suffix`, where `customer_id` is your customer ID. The *suffix* is any string the caller specifies. This string will be displayed verbatim in the administration console. This suffix is used in setting up Custom Access Levels in Context-Aware Access. Your organization's customer ID can be obtained from the URL: `GET https://www.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/customers/my_customer` The `id` field in the response contains the customer ID starting with the letter 'C'. The customer ID to be used in this API is the string after the letter 'C' (not including 'C')",
