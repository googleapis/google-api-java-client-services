/**
 * * TrafficShapingConfig defines the configuration for shaping API traffic by specifying a quota
 * limit and the duration over which this limit is enforced. This configuration helps to control and
 * manage the rate at which API calls are made on the client side, preventing service overload on
 * the backend. For example: - if the quota limit is 100 calls per 10 seconds, then the message
 * would be: { quota_limit: 100 duration: { seconds: 10 } } - if the quota limit is 100 calls per 5
 * minutes, then the message would be: { quota_limit: 100 duration: { seconds: 300 } } - if the
 * quota limit is 10000 calls per day, then the message would be: { quota_limit: 10000 duration: {
 * seconds: 86400 } and so on.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
