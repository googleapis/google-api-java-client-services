/**
 * PToken expresses policy-relevant properties of the data objects being processed and stored in
 * Google's production systems. See go/ptoken to learn more. PTokens are intentionally opaque: go
 * /ptokens-are-opaque. The following should be considered implementation details. Next ID: 8
 * INTERNAL: If both the Scalar and the Compound extensions are populated, we use the Compound and
 * discard the Scalar. In principle, this should never happen.
 *
