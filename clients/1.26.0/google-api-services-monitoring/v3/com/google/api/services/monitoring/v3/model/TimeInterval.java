/**
 * A time interval extending just after a start time through an end time. The start time must not be
 * later than the end time. The default start time is the end time, making the startTime value
 * technically optional. Whether this is useful depends on the MetricKind. If the start and end
 * times are the same, the interval represents a point in time. This is appropriate for GAUGE
 * metrics, but not for DELTA and CUMULATIVE metrics, which cover a span of time.
 *
