/**
 * Describes a ranking-based time series filter. Each input time series is ranked with an aligner.
 * The filter will allow up to num_time_series time series to pass through it, selecting them based
 * on the relative ranking.For example, if ranking_method is METHOD_MEAN,direction is BOTTOM, and
 * num_time_series is 3, then the 3 times series with the lowest mean values will pass through the
 * filter.
