/**
 * Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors
 * defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been
 * configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters,
 * e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature
 * `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or
 * authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key
 * ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST
 * reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized
 * by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature
 * with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload
 * is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any "attached" payload
 * and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on
 * the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message
 * that holds this signature).
