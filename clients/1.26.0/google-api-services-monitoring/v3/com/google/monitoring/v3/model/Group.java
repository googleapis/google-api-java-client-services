/**
 * The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group has a filter that is
 * matched against monitored resources and their associated metadata. If a group's filter matches an
 * available monitored resource, then that resource is a member of that group. Groups can contain
 * any number of monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any number of
 * groups.Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The parentName field identifies an
 * optional parent for each group. If a group has a parent, then the only monitored resources
 * available to be matched by the group's filter are the resources contained in the parent group. In
 * other words, a group contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of
 * all the group's ancestors. A group without a parent can contain any monitored resource.For
 * example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags:
 * "environment" and "role". A parent group has a filter, environment="production". A child of that
 * parent group has a filter, role="transcoder". The parent group contains all instances in the
 * production environment, regardless of their roles. The child group contains instances that have
 * the transcoder role and are in the production environment.The monitored resources contained in a
 * group can change at any moment, depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated
 * with the group and its ancestors.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
