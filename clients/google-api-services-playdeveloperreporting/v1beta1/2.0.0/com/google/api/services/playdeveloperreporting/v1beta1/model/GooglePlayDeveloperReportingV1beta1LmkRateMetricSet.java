/**
 * Singleton resource representing the set of LMK (Low Memory Kill) metrics. This metric set
 * contains LMKs data combined with usage data to produce a normalized metric independent of user
 * counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date
 * intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`.
 * **Supported metrics:** * `userPerceivedLmkRate` (`google.type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct
 * users in the aggregation period that experienced at least one LMK while they were actively using
 * your app (a user-perceived LMK). An app is considered to be in active use if it is displaying any
 * activity or executing any foreground service. * `userPerceivedLmkRate7dUserWeighted`
 * (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `userPerceivedLmkRate` in the last 7 days. The
 * daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. *
 * `userPerceivedLmkRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of
 * `userPerceivedLmkRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of
 * distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in
 * the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `userPerceivedLmkRate`
 * metrics. A user is counted in this metric if they used the app in the foreground during the
 * aggregation period. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in
 * users being counted multiple times. The value is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, 100,
 * 1,000 or 1,000,000, depending on the magnitude of the value. **Supported dimensions:** *
 * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user's device, e.g., 26. *
 * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel`
 * (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. The form of the identifier is
 * 'deviceBrand/device', where deviceBrand corresponds to Build.BRAND and device corresponds to
 * Build.DEVICE, e.g., google/coral. * `deviceBrand` (string): unique identifier of the user's
 * device brand, e.g., google. * `deviceType` (string): the type (also known as form factor) of the
 * user's device, e.g., PHONE. * `countryCode` (string): the country or region of the user's device
 * based on their IP address, represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code (e.g. US for the United
 * States). * `deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.). *
 * `deviceSocMake` (string): Make of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., Samsung.
 * [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MANUFACTURER) *
 * `deviceSocModel` (string): Model of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., "Exynos 2100".
 * [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MODEL) * `deviceCpuMake`
 * (string): Make of the device's CPU, e.g., Qualcomm. * `deviceCpuModel` (string): Model of the
 * device's CPU, e.g., "Kryo 240". * `deviceGpuMake` (string): Make of the device's GPU, e.g., ARM.
 * * `deviceGpuModel` (string): Model of the device's GPU, e.g., Mali. * `deviceGpuVersion`
 * (string): Version of the device's GPU, e.g., T750. * `deviceVulkanVersion` (string): Vulkan
 * version of the device, e.g., "4198400". * `deviceGlEsVersion` (string): OpenGL ES version of the
 * device, e.g., "196610". * `deviceScreenSize` (string): Screen size of the device, e.g., NORMAL,
 * LARGE. * `deviceScreenDpi` (string): Screen density of the device, e.g., mdpi, hdpi. **Required
 * permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-
 * only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** * vitals.errors contains normalized
 * metrics about crashes, another stability metric. * vitals.errors contains normalized metrics
 * about ANRs, another stability metric.
