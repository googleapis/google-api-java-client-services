/**
 * A single Drive activity comprising one or more Actions by one or more Actors on one or more
 * Targets. Some Action groupings occur spontaneously, such as moving an item into a shared folder
 * triggering a permission change. Other groupings of related Actions, such as multiple Actors
 * editing one item or moving multiple files into a new folder, are controlled by the selection of a
 * ConsolidationStrategy in the QueryDriveActivityRequest.
