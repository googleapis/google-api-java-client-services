/**
 * Represents a Target HTTP Proxy resource.
 *
 * Google Compute Engine has two Target HTTP Proxy resources:
 *
 * * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/targetHttpProxies) *
 * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionTargetHttpProxies)
 *
 * A target HTTP proxy is a component of Google Cloud HTTP load balancers.
 *
 * * targetHttpProxies are used by global external Application Load Balancers,   classic Application
 * Load Balancers, cross-region internal Application Load   Balancers, and Traffic Director. *
 * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by regional internal Application Load   Balancers and regional
 * external Application Load Balancers.
 *
 * Forwarding rules reference a target HTTP proxy, and the target proxy then references a URL map.
 * For more information, readUsing Target Proxies and  Forwarding rule concepts.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Compute Engine API. For a detailed explanation see:
