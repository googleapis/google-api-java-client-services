/**
 * Represents the styling that can be applied to a TextRun.
 *
 * If this text is contained in a shape with a parent placeholder, then these text styles may be
 * inherited from the parent. Which text styles are inherited depend on the nesting level of lists:
 *
 * * A text run in a paragraph that is not in a list will inherit its text style   from the the
 * newline character in the paragraph at the 0 nesting level of   the list inside the parent
 * placeholder. * A text run in a paragraph that is in a list will inherit its text style   from the
 * newline character in the paragraph at its corresponding nesting   level of the list inside the
 * parent placeholder.
 *
 * Inherited text styles are represented as unset fields in this message. If text is contained in a
 * shape without a parent placeholder, unsetting these fields will revert the style to a value
 * matching the defaults in the Slides editor.
 *
