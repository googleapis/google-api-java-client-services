/**
 * Monitoring configuration of the service.
 *
 * The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics for monitoring. In the
 * example, a monitored resource and two metrics are defined. The
 * `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent to both producer and consumer
 * projects, whereas the `library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count` metric is only sent to the
 * consumer project.
 *
 *     monitored_resources:     - type: library.googleapis.com/branch       labels:       - key:
 * /city         description: The city where the library branch is located in.       - key: /name
 * description: The name of the branch.     metrics:     - name:
 * library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count       metric_kind: DELTA       value_type: INT64
 * labels:       - key: /customer_id     - name: library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count
 * metric_kind: GAUGE       value_type: INT64       labels:       - key: /customer_id
 * monitoring:       producer_destinations:       - monitored_resource:
 * library.googleapis.com/branch         metrics:         -
 * library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count       consumer_destinations:       -
 * monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch         metrics:         -
 * library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count         - library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count
