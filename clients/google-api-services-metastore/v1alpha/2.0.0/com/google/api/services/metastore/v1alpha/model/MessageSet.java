 * This is proto2's version of MessageSet.DEPRECATED: DO NOT USE FOR NEW FIELDS.If you are using

 * proto2 was introduced, extensions were implemented as a first-class feature. This schema for
 * MessageSet was meant to be a "bridge" solution to migrate MessageSet-bearing messages from proto1
 * to proto2.This schema has been open-sourced only to facilitate the migration of Google products
 * with MessageSet-bearing messages to open-source environments.
