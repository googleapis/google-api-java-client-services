/**
 * Policy for ingress into ServicePerimeter. IngressPolicies match requests based on `ingress_from`
 * and `ingress_to` stanzas. For an ingress policy to match, both the `ingress_from` and
 * `ingress_to` stanzas must be matched. If an IngressPolicy matches a request, the request is
 * allowed through the perimeter boundary from outside the perimeter. For example, access from the
 * internet can be allowed either based on an AccessLevel or, for traffic hosted on Google Cloud,
 * the project of the source network. For access from private networks, using the project of the
 * hosting network is required. Individual ingress policies can be limited by restricting which
 * services and/or actions they match using the `ingress_to` field.
 *
