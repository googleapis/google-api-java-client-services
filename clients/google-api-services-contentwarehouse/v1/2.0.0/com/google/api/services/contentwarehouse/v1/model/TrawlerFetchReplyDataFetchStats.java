/**
 * The fetcher keeps track of various time intervals spent in the states of the fetcher url control
 * flow. Sometimes flows branch out into more than one flow (next flow), and we aggregate all the
 * time intervals spent in a specific state for all the flows to get the time interval for the
 * state. The time interval for a state is therefore not the time interval of an individual flow, if
 * the WaitNextFlow time is non zero. The WaitNextFlow interval included here is the time spent by
 * one flow waiting for another flow. Although the WaitNextFlow time is the time spent by a flow in
 * the WaitNextFlow state, its also equivalent to the entire timeline of another flow. It is the
 * time spent in the various states of another flow. In computing the total time spent in the
 * primary flow, one must omit the WaitNextFlow time, since it is already included in the form of
 * slices of individual state time intervals in the aggregated time intervals for other states, and
 * will result in double counting.
