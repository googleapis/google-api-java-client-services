/**
 * Plexity is a conceptual distinction between viewing something (a slot filler, for example) as a
 * single individual, or as a complex concept consisting of multiple individuals or subparts. Note
 * that plexity is not the same as (or correlated with) either grammatical number or with
 * distributive and collective interpretations of the slot. The PlexityRequirement proto and Plexity
 * enum are defined outside ValueType as we may move the plexity specification to a different place
 * in the intent protos in future.
