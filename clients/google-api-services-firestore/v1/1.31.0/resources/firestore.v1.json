The only valid special field is `*`, which represents any field. Field paths may be quoted using ` (backtick). The only character that needs to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include: `*`, `.`, ``` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters. Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) `\\`address.city\\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key `city` in the field `address`. `\\`*\\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field. A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields.

          "description": "The document's fields. The map keys represent field names. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty. Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by the simple or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by `.`. For example, the structured field `\"foo\" : { map_value: { \"x&y\" : { string_value: \"hello\" }}}` would be represented by the field path `foo.x&y`. Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and `` `bak\\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``."
