   * log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of `keyword_similarity_score`
   * with slight `semantic_smilarity_score` adjustment. - `0.2 *
   * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) + 0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank
   * by the exponent of `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN, also add
   * constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 *
   * rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 * rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by
   * the reciprocal rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of reciprocal rank of
   * `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`:
   * semantic similarity adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
   * proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically similar a search query is to a
   * document. * `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best Match 25 (BM25)
   * ranking function. This score is calculated using a probabilistic model to estimate the
   * probability that a document is relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic
   * relevance adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the meaning and intent
   * behind a user's query in context with the content in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted
   * conversion rate adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to gauge the
   * relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a user's perspective. A higher pCTR
   * suggests that the result is more likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a

   * The session resource name. Optional. Session allows users to do multi-turn /search API calls or
   * coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls. Example #1 (multi-turn /search
   * API calls): 1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below). 2. Call /search API
   * with the session ID generated in the first call. Here, the previous search query gets
   * considered in query standing. I.e., if the first query is "How did Alphabet do in 2022?" and
   * the current query is "How about 2023?", the current query will be interpreted as "How did
   * Alphabet do in 2023?". Example #2 (coordination between /search API calls and /answer API
   * calls): 1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below). 2. Call /answer API with
   * the session ID generated in the first call. Here, the answer generation happens in the context
   * of the search results from the first search call. Auto-session mode: when
   * `projects/.../sessions/-` is used, a new session gets automatically created. Otherwise, users
   * can use the create-session API to create a session manually. Multi-turn Search feature is
   * currently at private GA stage. Please use v1alpha or v1beta version instead before we launch
   * this feature to public GA. Or ask for allowlisting through Google Support team.
