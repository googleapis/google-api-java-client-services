/**
 * Configuration for a `WorkerPool` to run the builds. Workers provide a build environment where
 * Cloud Build runs your builds. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general use.
 * By default, when you submit a build, Cloud Build uses one of the workers from this pool. Builds
 * that run in the default worker pool have access to the public internet. If your build needs
 * access to resources on a private network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds.
 * Custom `WorkerPool`s give your builds access to any single VPC network that you administer,
 * including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC network. For an overview of custom worker
 * pools, see [Custom workers overview](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers
 * /custom-workers-overview).
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Cloud Build API. For a detailed explanation see:
