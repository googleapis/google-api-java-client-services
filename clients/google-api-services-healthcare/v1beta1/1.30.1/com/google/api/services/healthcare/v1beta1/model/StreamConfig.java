   * existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient",
   * "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts
   * to create one. When a table schema doesn't align with the schema config, either because of
   * existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not
   * stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the
   * server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table
   * recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource
   * mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are
   * appended to the corresponding BigQuery tables. Different versions of the same resource are
   * distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation
   * (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables
   * contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience,
   * the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current
   * resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely
   * unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single
   * unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL
   * select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair.
   * Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a
   * resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see
