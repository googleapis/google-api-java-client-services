However, if the `unit` is\n`KBy`, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no\nmatter how it may be displayed..\n\nIf you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used\nby a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is\n`s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005\nCPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`.\n\nAlternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more\ngranular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is\n`ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`),\nor use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`).\n\nThe supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of\nMeasure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:\n\n**Basic units (UNIT)**\n\n* `bit`   bit\n* `By`    byte\n* `s`     second\n* `min`   minute\n* `h`     hour\n* `d`     day\n* `1`     dimensionless\n\n**Prefixes (PREFIX)**\n\n* `k`     kilo    (10^3)\n* `M`     mega    (10^6)\n* `G`     giga    (10^9)\n* `T`     tera    (10^12)\n* `P`     peta    (10^15)\n* `E`     exa     (10^18)\n* `Z`     zetta   (10^21)\n* `Y`     yotta   (10^24)\n\n* `m`     milli   (10^-3)\n* `u`     micro   (10^-6)\n* `n`     nano    (10^-9)\n* `p`     pico    (10^-12)\n* `f`     femto   (10^-15)\n* `a`     atto    (10^-18)\n* `z`     zepto   (10^-21)\n* `y`     yocto   (10^-24)\n\n* `Ki`    kibi    (2^10)\n* `Mi`    mebi    (2^20)\n* `Gi`    gibi    (2^30)\n* `Ti`    tebi    (2^40)\n* `Pi`    pebi    (2^50)\n\n**Grammar**\n\nThe grammar also includes these connectors:\n\n* `/`    division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples,\n         `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never\n         have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed at\n         query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value).\n* `.`    multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For\n         examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`.\n\nThe grammar for a unit is as follows:\n\n    Expression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"/\" Component } ;\n\n    Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ]\n              | Annotation\n              | \"1\"\n              ;\n\n    Annotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ;\n\nNotes:\n\n* `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation\n   is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples,\n   `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`.\n* `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not\n   containing `{` or `}`.\n* `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless\n   unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such\n   as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are\n   appropriate. For example, \"new users per day\" can be represented as\n   `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean \"5 new\n   users). Alternatively, \"thousands of page views per day\" would be\n   represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric\n   value of `5.3` would mean \"5300 page views per day\").\n* `%` represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving\n   a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100,\n   and a metric value `3` means \"3 percent\").\n* `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range\n   0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage\n   (so a metric value `0.03` means \"3 percent\")."

Any version prefix will be replaced by the\n  version of the including interface plus the root path if\n  specified.\n\nExample of a simple mixin:\n\n    package google.acl.v1;\n    service AccessControl {\n      // Get the underlying ACL object.\n      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {\n        option (google.api.http).get = \"/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl\";\n      }\n    }\n\n    package google.storage.v2;\n    service Storage {\n      //       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);\n\n      // Get a data record.\n      rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {\n        option (google.api.http).get = \"/v2/{resource=**}\";\n      }\n    }\n\nExample of a mixin configuration:\n\n    apis:\n    - name: google.storage.v2.Storage\n      mixins:\n      - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl\n\nThe mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are\nalso declared with same name and request/response types in\n`Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will\nsee the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting\ndocumentation and annotations as follows:\n\n    service Storage {\n      // Get the underlying ACL object.\n      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {\n        option (google.api.http).get = \"/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl\";\n      }\n      ...\n    }\n\nNote how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.\n\nIf the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a\nrelative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:\n\n    apis:\n    - name: google.storage.v2.Storage\n      mixins:\n      - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl\n        root: acls\n\nThis implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:\n\n    service Storage {\n      // Get the underlying ACL object.\n      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {\n        option (google.api.http).get = \"/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl\";\n      }\n      ...\n    }",

      "description": "# gRPC Transcoding\n\ngRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or\nmore HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service\nthat supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google\nAPIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),\n[Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC\nGateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),\nand [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature\nand use it for large scale production services.\n\n`HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies\nhow different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL\npath, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the\ngRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is\ntypically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.\n\nEach mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path\ntemplate may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long\nas each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.\nThe path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to\nthe URL path.\n\nExample:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n            get: \"/v1/{name=messages/*}\"\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message GetMessageRequest {\n      string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.\n    }\n    message Message {\n      string text = 1; // The resource content.\n    }\n\nThis enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:\n\nHTTP | gRPC\n-----|-----\n`GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: \"messages/123456\")`\n\nAny fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template\nautomatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.\nFor example:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n            get:\"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message GetMessageRequest {\n      message SubMessage {\n        string subfield = 1;\n      }\n      string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.\n      int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.\n      SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.\n    }\n\nThis enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:\n\nHTTP | gRPC\n-----|-----\n`GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |\n`GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:\n\"foo\"))`\n\nNote that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a\nprimitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.\nIn the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL\nas `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the\nmessage is mapped to a separate parameter, such as\n`...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.\n\nFor HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field\nspecifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the\nmessage resource collection:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n          patch: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n          body: \"message\"\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message UpdateMessageRequest {\n      string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL\n      Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body\n    }\n\nThe following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the\nrepresentation of the JSON in the request body is determined by\nprotos JSON encoding:\n\nHTTP | gRPC\n-----|-----\n`PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:\n\"123456\" message { text: \"Hi!\" })`\n\nThe special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that\nevery field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the\nrequest body.  This enables the following alternative definition of\nthe update method:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n          patch: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n          body: \"*\"\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message Message {\n      string message_id = 1;\n      string text = 2;\n    }\n\n\nThe following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:\n\nHTTP | gRPC\n-----|-----\n`PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:\n\"123456\" text: \"Hi!\")`\n\nNote that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to\nhave HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in\nthe body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when\ndefining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods\nwhich don't use the URL at all for transferring data.\n\nIt is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using\nthe `additional_bindings` option. Example:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n          get: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n          additional_bindings {\n            get: \"/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}\"\n          }\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message GetMessageRequest {\n      string message_id = 1;\n      string user_id = 2;\n    }\n\nThis enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:\n\nHTTP | gRPC\n-----|-----\n`GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\")`\n`GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: \"me\" message_id:\n\"123456\")`\n\n## Rules for HTTP mapping\n\n1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request\n   message) are classified into three categories:\n   - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.\n   - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP\n     request body.\n   - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the\n     parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated\n     field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same\n     name.\n 2. If HttpRule.body is \"*\", there is no URL query parameter, all fields\n    are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.\n 3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all\n    fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.\n\n### Path template syntax\n\n    Template = \"/\" Segments [ Verb ] ;\n    Segments = Segment { \"/\" Segment } ;\n    Segment  = \"*\" | \"**\" | LITERAL | Variable ;\n    Variable = \"{\" FieldPath [ \"=\" Segments ] \"}\" ;\n    FieldPath = IDENT { \".\" IDENT } ;\n    Verb     = \":\" LITERAL ;\n\nThe syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches\nzero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path\nexcept the `Verb`.\n\nThe syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its\ntemplate. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable\nmatches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`\nis equivalent to `{var=*}`.\n\nThe syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`\ncontains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded\nbefore the matching.\n\nIf a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `\"{var}\"` or\n`\"{var=*}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client\nside, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The\nserver side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the\n[Discovery\nDocument](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as\n`{var}`.\n\nIf a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `\"{var=foo/*}\"`\nor `\"{var=**}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the\nclient side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.\nThe server side does the reverse decoding, except \"%2F\" and \"%2f\" are left\nunchanged. Such variables show up in the\n[Discovery\nDocument](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as\n`{+var}`.\n\n## Using gRPC API Service Configuration\n\ngRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language\nfor configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The\nservice config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`\nproto message.\n\nAs an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC\ntranscoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a\n`HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same\neffect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you\nhave a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding\nspecified in the service config will override any matching transcoding\nconfiguration in the proto.\n\nExample:\n\n    http:\n      rules:\n        # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.\n        - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage\n          get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}\n\n## Special notes\n\nWhen gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the\nproto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3\nspecification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).\n\nWhile the single segment variable follows the semantics of\n[RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String\nExpansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section\n3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion\ndoes not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead\nto invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding\nfor multi segment variables.\n\nThe path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,\nbecause client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.\n\nThe path variables **must not** capture the leading \"/\" character.
