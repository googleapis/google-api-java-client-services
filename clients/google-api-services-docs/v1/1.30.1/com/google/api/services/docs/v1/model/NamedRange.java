/**
 * A collection of Ranges with the same named range ID.
 *
 * Named ranges allow developers to associate parts of a document with an arbitrary user-defined
 * label so their contents can be programmatically read or edited at a later time. A document can
 * contain multiple named ranges with the same name, but every named range has a unique ID.
 *
 * A named range is created with a single Range, and content inserted inside a named range generally
 * expands that range. However, certain document changes can cause the range to be split into
 * multiple ranges.
 *
 * Named ranges are not private. All applications and collaborators that have access to the document
 * can see its named ranges.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Google Docs API. For a detailed explanation see:
