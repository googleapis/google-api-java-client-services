/**
 * The lifecycle state of an object, such as label, field, or choice. The lifecycle enforces the
 * following transitions: * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` (starting state) * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` ->
 * `PUBLISHED` * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -> (Deleted) * `PUBLISHED` -> `DISABLED` * `DISABLED` ->
 * `PUBLISHED` * `DISABLED` -> (Deleted) The published and disabled states have some distinct
 * characteristics: * Published—Some kinds of changes might be made to an object in this state, in
 * which case `has_unpublished_changes` will be true. Also, some kinds of changes are not permitted.
 * Generally, any change that would invalidate or cause new restrictions on existing metadata
 * related to the label are rejected. * Disabled—When disabled, the configured `DisabledPolicy`
 * takes effect.
 *
 * <p> This is the Java data model class that specifies how to parse/serialize into the JSON that is
 * transmitted over HTTP when working with the Drive Labels API. For a detailed explanation see:
