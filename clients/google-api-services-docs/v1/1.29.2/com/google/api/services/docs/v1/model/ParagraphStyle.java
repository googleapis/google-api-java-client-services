/**
 * Styles that apply to a whole paragraph.
 *
 * Inherited paragraph styles are represented as unset fields in this message. A paragraph style's
 * parent depends on where the paragraph style is defined:
 *
 *   * The ParagraphStyle on a Paragraph     inherits from the paragraph's corresponding named style
 * type.   * The ParagraphStyle on a named style     inherits from the normal text named style.   *
 * The ParagraphStyle of the normal text named style inherits     from the default paragraph style
 * in the Docs editor.   * The ParagraphStyle on a Paragraph     element that is contained in a
 * table may inherit its paragraph style from     the table style.
 *
 * If the paragraph style does not inherit from a parent, unsetting fields will revert the style to
 * a value matching the defaults in the Docs editor.
