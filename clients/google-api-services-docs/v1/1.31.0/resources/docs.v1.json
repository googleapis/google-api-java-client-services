Deleting text that crosses a paragraph boundary may result in changes to paragraph styles, lists, positioned objects and bookmarks as the two paragraphs are merged. Attempting to delete certain ranges can result in an invalid document structure in which case a 400 bad request error is returned. Some examples of invalid delete requests include: * Deleting one code unit of a surrogate pair. * Deleting the last newline character of a Body, Header, Footer, Footnote, TableCell or TableOfContents. * Deleting the start or end of a Table, TableOfContents or Equation without deleting the entire element. * Deleting the newline character before a Table, TableOfContents or SectionBreak without deleting the element. * Deleting individual rows or cells of a table. Deleting the content within a table cell is allowed.",

Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph's order within the list.",

For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies, the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the document, the document might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the document should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically."
