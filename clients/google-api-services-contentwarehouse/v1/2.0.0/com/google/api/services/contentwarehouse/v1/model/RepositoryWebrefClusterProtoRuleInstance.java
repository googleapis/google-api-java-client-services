/**
 * When we apply a rule to define a particular cluster, we have a RuleInstance. Some kinds of rules
 * for clusters define more than one cluster. In those rules we say things like "for each entity X
 * with this property, we create a cluster where..."; each particular cluster that we create is the
 * result of an *instance* of that rule, where the argument X has been bound to a particular entity
 * (note that this also applies to rules that define only one cluster; in that case, there are no
 * arguments). An entity that is part of a cluster plays a "role" in such a cluster. This message
 * describes such an instantiation of a rule with a role and with concrete values for the arguments.
